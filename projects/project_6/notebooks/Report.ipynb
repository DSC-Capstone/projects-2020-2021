    "After cleaning the text in the Twitter dataset, we have performed an exploratory data analysis on it. By calculating the term frequency and Tf-Idf throughout these Twitter posts, the tables of frequencies were acquired respectively. We noticed that these two vectorizers gave out similar results; for example, the three most frequent terms in both tables are “covid19”, “coronavirus”, and “trump”. In order to visually compare the results, a graph of the word cloud for both vectorizers was generated as shown in Figures 1 and 2 below."

    "To compare the daily term frequencies and the counts of daily covid-19 cases, we tried to visualize the difference between trends by drawing the frequencies of specific terms by dates overlaid the plot of Covid-19 case numbers. After intuitively preselecting the words “great” and “sick” (two words that represent positive and negative sentiment), two graphs are generated by plotting the normalized counts of terms per day and daily case numbers from March 22 to November 30. As shown in Figures 3 and 4, we observed that there are no direct or obvious correlations between the trend of selected terms and the count of daily new cases. "

    "As we can see in the above graphs in analysis, daily cases data has an upward mobility which is the result of multiple factors such as exponential transmitting rate and state policy. Our sentiment score does not have a trend in the long run. However, both of the data have a seasonality component which could be correlated. To detrend the data, we used the seasonal decompose module to locate the trends and use a regression of order 3 to compose the shape of the curve. We then subtracted the composition from the original data to obtain a flat version of daily cases with only the seasonality. By plotting the sentiment data with the detrended data we can see that they do have similar fluctuations in the previous three months, the crest and trough of the data roughly align with one another. One possible reason for the irregularities in later periods is that our detrended cases daily did not take into account how the upward trend affect the magnitude of the fluctuations. With the increase in cases per day, the fluctuation number also increases."
