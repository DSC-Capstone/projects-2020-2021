                    <p>Eric Liu is a fourth year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego who is majoring in Data Science and Philosophy. He expects to graduate in the Spring of 2022. In this project, Eric wrote the enterity of the frontend, most of the data cleaning code, set up the Django server and Heroku app, and generally kept the project and team members focused and working. Currently, Eric is the manager of the <a href="https://recreation.ucsd.edu/adventures/climbing-center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Outback Climbing Center</a>, a San Diego climbing gym, and does remote support for <a href="https://irokdds.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iROK Digital Dentistry Studio</a>.</p>
                    <p>Outside of work, Eric enjoys climbing, running, and skiing. His favorite climbing areas are <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105720495/joshua-tree-national-park" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joshua Tree National Park</a> and <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/area/105734111/indian-rock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indian Rock Park</a>. In both of these places, he has spent way too much time falling off rock, and not enough time climbing on top of rock. He definetly prefers to go bouldering, if you couldn't tell by the picture selection on this website. To learn more about Eric, you can look at his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-liu-655ab413b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn page</a> (which he tries to keep up to date), his <a href="https://github.com/twigtheoracle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>, or you can email him at <a href="mailto:eyl052@ucsd.edu">eyl052@ucsd.edu</a>.</p>
