I always get them when I'm at the mall! \n\nIf you download their app you get rewards for a free pretzel. \n\nI love the Wetzel's bites either salty or cinnamon. The Wetzel's dog bites are okay, they taste like hot dogs.","stars":5.0,"user_id":"7C4B2Skmh4X9f8xJDo9O4w"}

We've been here once before and very happy with the pies and service and so we came back. Once again DELISH!! We had the chocolate cream pie and the banana cream pie and we ate ALL of it. One day I'll catch the cherry pie but these were very tasty.","stars":5.0,"user_id":"Q6OjHSEwO55rGLo0Wczoug"}

Not many sports bars go out of their way to keep customers happy, like Zipps.\n\nUpdate: Still decent but could be better, doesn't seem like they want to make the atmosphere better. It's a pain to get a specific game on outside and to get volume is a real pain in the arse. Love the location but they could really make it better.\n\nDysfunctional! Hard to get games outside, service isn't very good, the 40 st location is way better, our group is taking our business elsewhere, a shame to because the location is great. They need to get better management.","stars":1.0,"user_id":"FsNBiid47SkFaWdhl7ciYQ"}

For some reason, THIS Carl's Jr. is one in a million. Yes, there is an In-and-Out across the street but this Carl's Jr is everything In-and-Out can't be. \n\nFirst of all, THEIR SHAKES!!! Carl's Jr. shakes are hand scooped, and mixed upon order unlike they're competitors across the street. The chocolate shake IS the best I've EVER had from a drive thru. Point for Carl's Jr.\n\nSecond, the hand battered chicken strips were literally hand battered, i watch the guy through the service window dip and fry. The single best chicken strips i've ever had (but they may need new sauces, tired of BBQ...but still outstanding nonetheless). Point 2 for Carl's Jr\n\nLastly, Hours. 24\/7 on the weekends and midnight on the weekdays. Brilliant for my late night guru-ness.\n\nWorth the drive!","stars":5.0,"user_id":"YDkC5VVT8s9NlIZtAr8NUA"}

The price is a little bit cheaper than other similar jumping places. The down fall is the loud music blasting over poor speakers.","stars":3.0,"user_id":"4cZD-pAOFt1k3VdTzW5R5Q"}

Customer service is key and he was keen on understanding what went wrong on the first visit so he could correct the situation. The second time around it was how I had hoped the first time. Service was just absolutely excellent; each member of the staff was professional and detailed in explaining the menu items along with the selected wines. The presentation was as good as the food tasted. My girlfriend took on the seafood dishes while I handled the meat dishes. Each was just exquisite in their preparation and taste while cooked to our liking accurately. Service on the table was prompt and not over bearing. The deserts were just flavor packed; even the small chocolate chip cookie that was served with the root beer was warm out of the oven. The passion fruit desert was like biting into a delicious fresh passion fruit. \n\nI have to say Manager and the restaurant has earned a third visit from me and I will look forward to that day.","stars":5.0,"user_id":"YIjln3huUyq29CDPBSjLdQ"}

The waitresses are top of the line.  Always so professional and accomodating.  And yes, they will upsell you on dessert ;)","stars":5.0,"user_id":"bNDNAnynGFLqDsJhSO_U1w"}
