    "\n",
    "Nowadays, people cannot live without their cellphones. People store their important information on their smartphones and use their cellphones for daily communication. The Android Operating System takes over 80% market share of smartphones' operating system. However, as an open source market, about 20% of applications in the market are considered as malicious applications. Those apps will track the user's data, send messages unconsciously, or even lock the user's smartphone until the user pays the ransom.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the seriousness of the malware problem, detecting methods become an expanding research field in academic circles. One most popular detecting method is called HinDroid. It checks the relationships between applications using Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN). To further improve the HinDroid, we plan to design a new model based on the idea of HinDroid and HIN. Meanwhile, we will also implement other models like Metapath2vec and Node2vec in order to evaluate our new model.\n"

    "## Problem statement and Previous work\n",
    "\n",
    "As an open source market, Android is often targeted by hackers to build malicious applications. HinDroid uses Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) to find the similarities between applications and detect malwares. HinDroid design matrices A, B, P, and I, which each matrix represent a kind of relationship between apis or apps by using 1/0. For instance, A matrix represents whether an API is in an app or not. HinDroid then develops different kernels and uses the meta paths between apps to check relationships among apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this quarter’s study, we replicate HinDroid. We start from feature extraction and then build our own A, B, and P matrices based on the Android Malware Dataset (AMD). Due to the complexity of the variables we extract and the size of the features, we design a database to store the information. We also try multiple kernels like $AA^{T}$, $ABA^{T}$, $APA^{T}$, and $APBP^{T}A^{T}$ to make predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the implementation of HinDroid, we find some constraints of HinDroid. For example, A matrix only uses 1/0 to represent whether an api is in an app. However, an api might be called multiple times in an app and those apis should be considered more important than others. In addition, when we try kernels with the B matrix, due to the large size of the B matrix, lots of kernels containing the B matrix will take longer computational time and even lead to kernel death. "

    "## Goals and Deliverables \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we receive 96.77% on testing accuracy when using the $AA^{T}$ kernel. However, the recall of it is still 0.9655. In this project, our goal will be finding a better model to represent the relationships between applications and locate the exact part of the code which takes the malicious action. We want to improve current HinDroid and build a more robust model for detecting malwares. By adding new features, designing new kernels, and using other models, we want to build a new model with faster speed and higher accuracy. The outcome will be a paper which describes the new model and compares different models.\n"

    "\n",

For example, the `class type` and `method type` might also give us some hints. For example, the class and method can be private or public. The `return type` can also help us identify what is the function doing and the outcome of the function. More research is also needed for this part to help us understand how the hackers will put malicious action inside the code and how we should select that part out.\n",

Since the B matrix is in dimension the number of APIs times the number of APIs, the B matrix will be really large. Currently, the B matrix contains 2177789 x 2177789 columns, which represent that there are 2177789 unique api calls in total 742 apps. Since there are lots of APIs occurring in almost every application and some APIs only occur in a few applications, we want to select out most representative APIs which can represent whether the application is malware or not."

Therefore, precision and recall are both important for us. We will use the F1 score as a reference to check our new model.\n",
    "Since hackers keep developing new methods to avoid detection, we also need to check our model with datas from different times, especially the most recent data. When making comparisons, we also want to compare their performance based on different years since we do not want our outcome to be useful in a few years.\n",
    " Graphs are also important for our models. Since HinDroid, Metapath2vec, Node2vec, Word2vec, and our new model are all based on the idea of graphs to check the relationship between apps, it is important to try to plot the graph to show the algorithm behind each model.
