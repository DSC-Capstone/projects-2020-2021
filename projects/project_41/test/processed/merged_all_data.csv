Second Quarter 2005 Highlights
 
 
 
 
 
 Alcoa (NYSE:AA) announced today the highest quarterly income and revenue in the company's history. Second quarter income from continuing operations was $473 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, up from $0.31 in the first quarter of 2005 and $0.46 in the second quarter of 2004.
NEW YORKJuly 7, 2005
 
Net income for the quarter was $460 million, or $0.52, up 77 percent over the first quarter's $260 million, or $0.30, and up 14 percent over the $404 million, or $0.46, of the second quarter of 2004.
 
Both net income and income from continuing operations include the effects of the following previously announced second quarter events:
 
 
 
 
 
In total, these items net to a positive benefit of $0.08 per share in the quarter.
 
""We achieved the highest quarterly income and revenues in Alcoa history,"" said Alain Belda, Alcoa Chairman and CEO. ""We delivered strong results and took necessary steps to restructure, control costs, and lay the framework for solid performance over the long term.""
 
Results Overview
 
Revenues for the quarter were $6.8 billion, an increase of 13 percent year-over-year and 8 percent on a sequential quarter basis, and the highest quarterly sales in the company's history. Revenues were driven by higher volumes and the company's acquisition of fabricating facilities in Russia. A record performance by the alumina business, a better mix of value-added fabricated products, coupled with stronger pricing and demand in the aerospace, commercial vehicle and building markets drove revenues higher, offsetting lower realized prices in the primary metals business. All of the company's six major business segments achieved third-party revenue growth versus year ago and sequential quarter comparisons.
 
The company continues to drive its savings program to offset the pressure of higher input prices and energy costs. In the second quarter, the company announced the second stage of its 2005 restructuring plan, which will result in the elimination of approximately 8100 positions and $195 million from its cost base when fully implemented. The restructuring is driven by a new global business structure that is designed to optimize operations and better serve customers globally.
 
""We're working to offset cost increases and deliver solid results,"" said Belda. ""Our restructuring program will help further position the company to eliminate costs and place us in a stronger position to deliver for our customers throughout the world.""
The company had approximately $60 million of cost increases in the quarter across items such as energy, resins and other raw materials, which offset cost reduction efforts in the quarter.
 
The company's trailing 12 month return on capital at the end of the second quarter 2005 was 8.3 percent, versus 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
 
Strategic Acquisitions and Divestitures
 
The integration of the recently acquired Samara and Belaya Kalitva plants in Russia resulted in losses for the quarter of approximately $29 million after taxes due to integration costs, general market softness, especially in Europe, and the costs of initiatives to shift to higher value-added products. The company expects second half losses for the plants to be approximately $40 to $50 million after taxes.
 
Alcoa tendered its 46.5 percent stake in Elkem ASA for $869 million in cash, and recorded a $219 million gain after taxes on the transaction in the quarter. Alcoa continues to hold a 50 percent stake in two Norwegian aluminum smelters in Norway with combined capacity of 282,000 metric tons per year.
 
In the quarter the company purchased the 40 percent interest in the Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Ltd. joint venture currently owned by its partner Shanghai Light Industrial Equipment (Group) Company, Ltd. Alcoa (Shanghai) Aluminum Products Ltd. will now be a wholly owned foreign enterprise and will continue to sell foil products to customers throughout Asia.
 
Balance Sheet and Growth Projects
 
In the quarter, capital expenditures were $487 million as the company invested in its growth projects in Western Australia, Iceland, and Brazil. Full year capital spending is estimated to be approximately $2.2 billion, with more than half dedicated to growth projects.
 
Progress continued during the quarter on construction of the new Alcoa Fjardaal aluminum smelter in Iceland set for production in 2007 as well as the expansion of the Alumar smelter in Brazil by 63,000 mtpy, which is expected to start production in the third quarter. The company continues negotiations with the government of the Republic of Ghana to re-start the Valco smelter.
The company also continued work on the efficiency upgrade at its Pinjarra alumina refinery in Australia, which is expected to increase production there by 600,000 mtpy by the end of 2005. The company began an expansion of the Jamalco alumina refinery in Clarendon, Jamaica as the first phase of a possible 1.5 million mtpy capacity expansion there. The first phase of expansion, an additional 150,000 mtpy, is expected to be completed by the end of 2006.
 
The company also began work to expand its global aerospace heat-treated sheet and plate production by approximately 50 percent over the next 18 months in response to orders from its aerospace customers, such as the nearly $2 billion high-performance sheet and plate supply agreement it signed with Airbus.
 
Cash from operations in the quarter was $384 million. Debt to capital stood at 32.2 percent at the end of the second quarter, a 110 basis point improvement from first quarter of 2005.
 
Segment and Other Results
 
Segment Changes
 
All comparisons are on a sequential quarter basis and after tax operating income (ATOI), unless noted.
 
Alumina - ATOI for the segment was at an all-time high of $182 million, up $21 million or 13 percent. Stronger pricing of third party shipments and increased internal demand for smelter restarts drove the increase in profitability. Alumina production for the quarter was 3,637 thousand metric tons (""kmt""), compared to 3,583 kmt in the first quarter of 2005.
 
Primary Metals - Segment profitability decreased $38 million or 17 percent, primarily because of lower realized metal prices and higher energy costs. Primary metal production for the quarter rose 48 kmt to 899 kmt, as re-starts in North America were completed. Realized metal prices declined by $65 a ton or 3% in the quarter to $1,977 a ton. The company purchased roughly 163 kmt of primary metal for internal use as part of its strategy to sell value-added products.
 
Flat Rolled Products  ATOI for the segment was $70 million. Excluding the impact of the new Russian facilities ($21 million loss), segment profitability increased to $91 million. Continued improved performance was driven by favorable pricing and mix in both North America and Europe as shipments of aerospace and other high value products rose.
 
Extruded and End Products  Higher shipments and revenue across many businesses within the segment doubled ATOI in the quarter to $20 million, overcoming a $6 million loss associated with the Russian assets. Seasonal improvements at Alcoa Home Exteriors also contributed to the results.
Engineered Solutions  ATOI for the segment was $60 million, relatively unchanged from the first quarter. Continued strong performance from key businesses serving the aerospace market, Howmet and Alcoa Fastening Systems, helped to partially offset declines at Alcoa Fujikura Automotive caused by weaker pricing and higher input costs.
 
Packaging and Consumer - Segment ATOI increased sharply to $47 million driven by seasonal demand increases in the consumer products and closure businesses. Compared to the year ago quarter, revenue in the segment grew by 9% largely based on raw material pricing pass through. However, all raw material increases could not be passed on to customers, leading to lower segment profitability.
 
ATOI to Net Income Reconciliation
 
The largest variances in reconciling items were in the ""restructuring and other charges"" and ""other"" line items. ""Restructuring and Other Charges"" records the after-tax impact of the previously announced restructuring charges. Included in the ""other"" line item is the gain on the sale of the Elkem shares and the tax benefit from the finalization of certain tax reviews.
 
Income from Discontinued Operations is comprised of operating losses and anticipated losses upon the sale of the discontinued operations.
 
Quarterly Conference Call
 
Alcoa will hold its quarterly conference call at 5:00 PM Eastern Time on July 7th to present the quarter's results. The meeting will be webcast via alcoa.com. Call information and related details are available at under ""Invest.""

On July 9, 2007, Alcoa Inc. issued a press release announcing its financial results for the second quarter of 2007. A copy of the press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99 and is incorporated herein by reference.
The information in this Current Report on Form 8-K, including Exhibit 99, is being furnished in accordance with the provisions of General Instruction B.2 of Form 8-K.
 
 
The following is furnished as an exhibit to this report:

Exhibit 99
 
Highlights:
 Alcoa (NYSE: AA) today announced second quarter 2007 income from continuing operations of $716 million, or $0.81 per diluted share, the second best quarterly performance in the Company's history and completing its best ever first half in revenues, earnings and cash from operations. 2007 second quarter income from continuing operations represented a five percent increase from the $0.77 in the first quarter of 2007. In the second quarter of 2006, income from continuing operations was $0.85.
NEW YORK, NY  July 9, 2007
 
Net income for the quarter was $715 million, or $0.81, an eight percent increase from the first quarter of 2007. Net income for the second quarter 2006 was $744 million, or $0.85.
For the first half of 2007, income from continuing operations grew to an all-time record of $1.39 billion, up from last year's $1.36 billion first-half results. First half 2007 net income also reached a record $1.38 billion compared to $1.35 billion in 2006.
Revenues for the quarter reached an all-time quarterly record of $8.1 billion, up from $7.9 billion in the first quarter of 2007 and $7.8 billion from a year ago. The increase was driven by higher volumes and improved mix.
Second quarter 2007 after-tax operating income (ATOI) increased in five of the Company's six operating segments over the prior quarter. The Company's downstream Flat-Rolled Products, Extruded and End Products, and Engineered Solutions each achieved all-time quarterly ATOI records.
Included in the quarterly results was a favorable after-tax restructuring adjustment of $21 million, or $0.02 per share. This was generated mainly by the completion of the soft alloy extrusion joint venture with Sapa. The quarterly results also included $0.02 per share in after-tax transaction costs stemming from the Company's outstanding offer for Alcan.
The strong quarterly results were achieved despite $36 million after tax, or $0.04 per share, of curtailment costs at the Tennessee and Rockdale, TX smelters.
""We have achieved another strong quarter, with record cash generation, record downstream performance, and our lowest debt-to-capital ratio in nearly eight years, while continuing an ambitious investment program,"" said Alain Belda, Alcoa Chairman and CEO. ""In the quarter, we also made a compelling offer to acquire Alcan, and are proceeding well with the regulatory approvals necessary to complete that transaction,"" said Belda. ""We remain the natural partner for Alcan with the most substantial synergies, and an unparalleled commitment to Canada and Qubec.""
Cash from operations in the second quarter rose to a record $1.35 billion, a more than $800 million improvement from the first quarter of 2007. The Company's strong cash generation performance in the quarter helped to fund its growth programs. In the quarter, capital expenditures were $891 million, 67 percent of which was devoted to growth projects.
The Company's debt-to-capital ratio stood at 29.4 percent at the end of the quarter, the lowest so far this decade. The Company's 12-month trailing return
on capital (ROC) stood at 11.8 percent at the end of the second quarter, including ongoing major investments in growth. That is higher than the 11.2 percent trailing ROC in 2006. Excluding investments in growth, the 12-month trailing ROC was 14.7 percent in the second quarter of 2007, compared to 12.8 percent in 2006.
During the quarter, Alcoa also completed the formation of a joint venture with Sapa of its soft alloy extrusion business. The Company also continued to make progress on its strategic review of its packaging and consumer and automotive castings and electrical systems businesses. Alcoa anticipates that process will be completed by the end of 2007.
Update On Offer For Alcan
Alcoa today extended the expiration time for its offer to acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Alcan Inc., (TSX: AL; NYSE: AL) from 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, on July 10, 2007, to 5:00 p.m., Eastern Daylight Saving Time, on August 10, 2007, subject to further extension. The offer was announced by Alcoa on May 7, 2007.
All other terms and conditions of Alcoa's offer remain unchanged. Alcoa expects to mail a formal notice of extension to Alcan shareholders shortly. The notice of extension will also be electronically available on the SEDAR website at www.sedar.com and on the EDGAR website at www.sec.gov.
""This extension period will provide Alcan's shareholders with more time to consider our offer while we continue to pursue the various governmental and regulatory approvals necessary to complete the offer,"" said Belda.
Alcoa last week said it received a request for additional information from the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice regarding its outstanding offer for Alcan. The Company also reiterated its confidence the transaction would be approved in each jurisdiction. Approximately 418,500 Alcan common shares had been deposited and not withdrawn under Alcoa's offer to date.
Segment and Other Results
Alumina
ATOI was $276 million, an increase of $16 million, or 6 percent, over the prior quarter. Higher overall prices and shipments were partially offset by the appreciation of the Australian dollar. Quarterly production increased by 144 kmt or 4 percent.
Primary Metals
ATOI was $462 million, down $42 million, or eight percent, compared to the prior quarter. The ATOI decrease resulted from lower LME prices, Rockdale and Tennessee curtailment costs, unfavorable currency, and Iceland start-up costs. Third-party realized metal prices decreased $23 per metric ton to $2,879 per ton. Primary metal production for the quarter increased 2 kmt to 901 kmt due mainly to the restart of a second potline at the Intalco smelter, net of the Rockdale and Tennessee outages. The Company purchased approximately 46 kmt of primary metal for internal use.
Flat-Rolled Products
The segment established a quarterly ATOI record of $93 million, up $31 million or 50 percent from the prior quarter. These record results were driven by continued strength in aerospace and higher volumes in can sheet. Productivity gains continue to exceed cost inflation. In addition, improved Russia performance contributed to the ATOI increase.
Extruded and End Products
The segment established a quarterly ATOI record of $46 million, up $12 million or 35 percent, from the prior quarter. The improvement was due to strong markets, especially Europe, and improved productivity. Effective June 1, 2007 the soft alloy extrusion joint venture with Sapa was completed. The associated volume and revenue will no longer be recorded in this segment; equity income from the joint venture will be recorded here.
Engineered Solutions
Another segment quarterly ATOI record was established of $105 million, up $12 million or 13 percent from the prior quarter. Strong markets, market share gains and new product offerings throughout our portfolio continue to more than offset the substantial decline in U.S. Class 8 truck market of approximately 50% compared to year ago quarter. In addition, productivity gains continue to outpace cost inflation.
Packaging and Consumer
ATOI was $37 million, an increase of $18 million, or 95 percent, over the prior quarter. This sequential quarter increase was driven by the normal seasonal upturn in the Consumer and Closures businesses as well as continued productivity improvements.
ATOI to Net Income Reconciliation
The largest variances in reconciling items were in the ""Corporate Expense,"" ""Restructuring & Other Charges"" and ""Other"" line items. ""Corporate Expense"" includes the transaction costs stemming from the Company's outstanding offer for Alcan. ""Restructuring & Other Charges"" includes the favorable after-tax impact from completion of the soft alloy extrusion joint venture with Sapa.
""Other"" includes a portion of the Tennessee curtailment cost due to our captive insurance company.
Alcoa will hold its quarterly conference call at 5:00 PM Eastern Time on July 9, 2007 to present the quarter's results. The meeting will be webcast via alcoa.com. Call information and related details are available at under ""Invest.""

WHERE TO FIND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
In connection with the offer by Alcoa to purchase all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Alcan (the ""Offer""), Alcoa has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") a registration statement on Form S-4 (the ""Registration Statement""), which contains a prospectus relating to the Offer (the ""Prospectus""), and a tender offer statement on Schedule TO (the ""Schedule TO""), each as amended. This communication is not a substitute for the Prospectus, the Registration Statement and the Schedule TO. ALCAN SHAREHOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE URGED TO READ THESE DOCUMENTS, ALL OTHER APPLICABLE DOCUMENTS AND ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO ANY SUCH DOCUMENTS WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE, BECAUSE EACH CONTAINS OR WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT ALCOA, ALCAN AND THE OFFER. Materials filed with the SEC are available electronically without charge at the SEC's website, www.sec.gov. Materials filed with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities (""CSRA"") are available electronically without charge at www.sedar.com. Materials filed with the SEC or the CSRA may also be obtained without charge at Alcoa's website, www.alcoa.com, or by directing a request to Alcoa's investor relations department at (212) 836-2674. In addition, Alcan shareholders may obtain free copies of such materials filed with the SEC or the CSRA by directing a written or oral request to the Information Agent for the Offer, MacKenzie Partners, Inc., toll-free at (800) 322-2885 (English) or (888) 405-1217 (French).
While the Offer is being made to all holders of Alcan Common Shares, this communication does not constitute an offer or a solicitation in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. The Offer is not being made in, nor will deposits be accepted in, any jurisdiction in which the making or acceptance thereof would not be in compliance with the laws of such jurisdiction. However, Alcoa may, in its sole discretion, take such action as it may deem necessary to extend the Offer in any such jurisdiction.
 
 
 
 
 
 
Certain amounts for the first and second quarter of 2006 included in the Extruded and End Products segment and the Reconciliation of ATOI have been reclassified to reflect the movement of the home exteriors business to discontinued operations in the third quarter of 2006. Also, the equity income reflected in the Extruded and End Products segment for the second quarter of 2007 represents Alcoa's share of the results of operations for the month of June 2007 of the newly formed joint venture with Orkla ASA's Sapa Group (Sapa) that combined Alcoa's soft alloy extrusions business with Sapa's Profiles extruded aluminum business.
The difference between certain segment financial information totals and consolidated financial information is in Corporate.
 
 
Return on capital, excluding growth investments is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because it provides greater insight with respect to the underlying operating performance of the company's productive assets. The company has significant growth investments underway in its upstream and downstream businesses, as previously noted, with expected completion dates over the next several years. As these investments generally require a period of time before they are productive, management believes that a return on capital measure excluding these growth investments is more representative of current operating performance.
 
Days of Working Capital
 
Days of Working Capital = Working Capital divided by (Sales/number of days in the quarter)
 
Income from continuing operations  excluding restructuring and other charges and transaction costs is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because management reviews the operating results of Alcoa excluding the impacts of restructuring and other charges and transaction costs. There can be no assurances that additional restructuring and other charges and transaction costs will not occur in future periods. To compensate for this limitation, management believes that it is appropriate to consider both income from continuing operations determined under GAAP as well as income from continuing operations  excluding restructuring and other charges and transaction costs.

CUPERTINO, CaliforniaOctober 11, 2005Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2005 fourth quarter ended September 24, 2005, reporting the highest revenue and earnings in the Company's history.

These results compare to revenue of $2.35 billion and a net profit of $106 million, or $.13 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 28.1 percent, up from 27.0 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 40 percent of the quarter's revenue.
 
Earnings per share benefited by $.12 from several tax items related to net deferred tax assets, tax reserves, and a revision to the full year tax rate estimated in prior quarters.
 
Apple shipped 1,236,000 Macintosh units and 6,451,000 iPods during the quarter, representing 48 percent growth in Macs and 220 percent growth in iPods over the year-ago quarter.
 
For fiscal 2005, the Company generated revenue of $13.93 billion and a net profit of $1.335 billion, reflecting annual growth of 68 percent and 384 percent, respectively, and representing the highest annual revenue and net profit in the Company's history.
 
""We're thrilled to have concluded the best year in Apple's history, with 68 percent year-over-year revenue growth and 384 percent net profit growth,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""This is the direct result of our focus on innovation and the immense talent and creativity at Apple. We could not be more excited about the new products we're working on for 2006.""
 
""We're very pleased to report 48 percent year-over-year growth in Mac shipments in Q4, as well as our 10th consecutive quarter of record iPod sales,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2006 which will span 14 weeks, we expect revenue of about $4.7 billion. We expect GAAP earnings per diluted share of about $.46, including an estimated $.03 per share expense impact from non-cash share-based compensation, translating to non-GAAP EPS of about $.49.""
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q4 2005 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple's standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming.

This press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings as well as the estimated expense impact of adoption of SFAS 123R for the first quarter of fiscal 2006. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ. Potential risks and uncertainties include continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the effect competitive and economic factors and the Company's reaction to them may have on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new programs, products and successful technological innovations to the marketplace; the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources including G4 and G5 microprocessors; possible disruption in commercial activities caused by terrorist activity and armed conflict, such as changes in logistics and security arrangements, and reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; possible disruption in commercial activity as a result of natural disasters or major health concerns including epidemics; risks associated with the Company's retail initiative including significant investment cost, uncertain consumer acceptance and potential impact on existing reseller relationships; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party music content; the ability of the Company to successfully evolve its operating system; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new products with Intel microprocessors and related hardware and software technological changes and innovations to support Intel microprocessors; the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to deliver products based on Intel microprocessors in a timely manner; the Company's dependency on third-party software developers to timely develop future applications that support Intel microprocessors and Power PC microprocessors; and the potential negative impact the transition of all Macs to Intel microprocessors by the end of 2007, or the announcement of such transition, might have on sales of current or future Mac products with Power PC processors.

CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJanuary 18, 2006Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2006 first quarter ended December 31, 2005, reporting the highest revenue and earnings in the Company's history. Apple posted revenue of $5.75 billion and a net quarterly profit of $565 million, or $.65 per diluted share, in this 14-week quarter. These results compare to revenue of $3.49 billion and a net profit of $295 million, or $.35 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter.

Apple shipped 1,254,000 Macintosh computers and 14,043,000 iPods during the quarter, representing 20 percent growth in Macs and 207 percent growth in iPods over the year-ago quarter.
 
""We are thrilled to report the best quarter in Apple's history,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""Two highlights of an incredible quarter were selling 14 million iPods and getting ready to launch our new Macs with Intel processors five to six months ahead of expectations. We are working on more wonderful products for 2006, and I can't wait to see what our customers think of them.""
 
""We're very pleased to report year-over-year revenue growth of 65 percent and net income that was nearly twice the year-ago level,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2006, we expect revenue of about $4.3 billion. We expect GAAP earnings per diluted share of about $.38, including an estimated $.04 per share expense impact from non-cash stock-based compensation, translating to non-GAAP EPS of about $.42.""

These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ.

The Company uses these non-GAAP measures when evaluating its financial results as well as for internal planning and forecasting purposes.  These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as a substitute for the Company's GAAP results. The Company adopted the fair-value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 revised (123R) to expense stock-based compensation in its fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2005.  Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company accounted for employee stock-based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB No. 25.

Apple Reports Third Quarter Results
Posts Second Highest Quarterly Revenue and Earnings in Company's History
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJuly 19, 2006Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2006 third quarter ended July 1, 2006. The Company posted revenue of $4.37 billion and a net quarterly profit of $472 million, or $.54 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $3.52 billion and a net profit of $320 million, or $.37 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 30.3 percent, up from 29.7 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 39 percent of the quarter's revenue.
 
Apple shipped 1,327,000 Macintosh computers and 8,111,000 iPods during the quarter, representing 12 percent growth in Macs and 32 percent growth in iPods over the year-ago quarter.
 
""We're thrilled with the growth of our Mac business, and especially that over 75 percent of the Macs sold during the quarter used Intel processors. This is the smoothest and most successful transition that any of us have ever experienced,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""In addition, iPod continued to earn a US market share of over 75 percent and we are extremely excited about future iPod products in our pipeline.""
 
""We're very pleased to report the second highest quarterly sales and earnings in Apple's history, resulting in year-over-year revenue growth of 24 percent and earnings growth of 48 percent,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, we expect revenue of about $4.5 to $4.6 billion. We expect GAAP earnings per diluted share of about $.46 to $.48, including an estimated $.03 per share expense impact from non-cash stock-based compensation, translating to non-GAAP EPS of about $.49 to $.51.""
 
As previously announced, an internal investigation discovered irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001. A special committee of Apple's outside directors has hired independent counsel to perform an investigation and the Company has informed the SEC. At this time, based upon the irregularities identified to date, management does not anticipate any material adjustment to the financial results included in this earnings release. However, if additional irregularities are identified by the independent investigation, a material adjustment to the financial information could be required.
 
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q3 2006 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple's standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming.

This press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings per share, the estimated expense impact of non-cash stock-based compensation, and the potential for adjustments to the financial results included in this earnings release based upon irregularities related to the issuance of certain stock option grants made between 1997 and 2001. These statements involve risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include the outcome of the recently-announced investigation into the Company's historical stock option grants and any potential resulting impact on the Company's financial statements or results; the effect competitive and economic factors and the Company's reaction to them may have on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; possible disruption in commercial activities caused by terrorist activity and armed conflict, such as changes in logistics and security arrangements, and reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; possible disruption in commercial activity as a result of natural disasters or major health concerns including epidemics; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to successfully evolve its operating system; the potential negative ramifications of the transition of all Macs to Intel microprocessors by the end of calendar 2006, or the announcement of such planned transition, for sales of current or future Mac products with Power PC processors; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new products with Intel microprocessors and related hardware and software technological changes and innovations to support Intel microprocessors; the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to deliver products based on Intel microprocessors in a timely manner; the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new programs, products and successful technological innovations to the marketplace; the effect that product quality problems could have on the Company's sales and operating profits; the inventory risk associated with the Company's need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party digital content; the Company's dependency on third-party software developers to timely develop future applications that support Intel microprocessors and Power PC microprocessors; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; and risks associated with the Company's retail initiative including significant investment cost, uncertain consumer acceptance and potential impact on existing reseller relationships.

Exhibit 99.1
Apple Reports Preliminary Fourth Quarter Results
Ships Record 1.61 Million Macs
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaOctober 18, 2006Apple today announced preliminary financial results for its fiscal 2006 fourth quarter ended September 30, 2006. These preliminary results may be subject to significant adjustment as a result of a likely restatement of historical results.
The Company posted revenue of $4.84 billion and net quarterly profit of $546 million, or  $.62 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $3.68 billion and net profit of $430 million, or $.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 29.2 percent, up from 28.1 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 40 percent of the quarter's revenue.
Apple shipped 1,610,000 Macintosh computers and 8,729,000 iPods during the quarter, representing 30 percent growth in Macs and 35 percent growth in iPods over the year-ago quarter.
""This strong quarter caps an extraordinary year for Apple. Selling more than 39 million iPods and 5.3 million Macs while performing an incredibly complex architecture transition is something we are all very proud of,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""Looking forward, 2007 is likely to be one of the most exciting new product years in Apple's history.""
""We are pleased to have finished the year with over $10 billion in cash and to have increased annual revenue by $11 billion in the last two years,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2007, we expect revenue of $6.0 to $6.2 billion and earnings per diluted share of $.70 to $.73.""
Results Subject to Significant Adjustment
As previously announced on October 4, 2006, an independent committee investigating Apple's stock option practices has reported its findings, which are under review by the Company and its independent auditors. The investigation determined, among other things, that stock option grants made on 15 dates between 1997 and 2002 appear to have grant dates that precede the approval of those grants for accounting purposes. As a result, management continues to believe, and the audit committee agrees, that Apple will likely need to restate its historical financial statements to record non-cash charges for compensation expense and related cash and non-cash tax adjustments relating to past stock option grants. The Company and its independent auditors are reviewing accounting guidance regarding stock option grants recently published by the SEC, and have not yet determined the amount of such charges, the resulting tax and accounting impact, or which periods may require restatement. Under applicable accounting standards, such compensation expense generally reflects the difference between an option's exercise price and the market price of the Company's stock at the measurement date, the point at which the terms of the option grant were actually finalized. According to the recent SEC guidance, companies must evaluate stock option grants in light of all relevant facts, circumstances and patterns of conduct to determine whether grants were actually finalized on the stated grant dates. Evidence of a practice that certain grants were not finalized on the stated grant date may require a conclusion that the grant date is not the measurement date for other grants as well. Therefore, it is possible that the Company and its independent auditors could conclude that a larger number of grant dates than previously identified could have a measurement date that differs from the grant date, which could result in significant additional non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Such charges may result in material changes to the Company's financial statements, including those covering the periods presented in this release.
This press release contains forward-looking statements about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings per share and the potential for significant adjustments to the financial results included in this release. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include the outcome of the pending reviews described above and the likely restatement of the Company's financial statements or results; the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company's reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; possible disruption in commercial activities caused by terrorist activity and armed conflict, such as changes in logistics and security arrangements, and reduced end-user purchases relative to expectations; possible disruption in commercial activity as a result of natural disasters or major health concerns including epidemics; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to successfully evolve its operating system; the potential negative ramifications of the transition of all Macs to Intel microprocessors; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new products with Intel microprocessors and related hardware and software technological changes and innovations to support Intel microprocessors; the development and availability on acceptable terms of components and services essential to enable the Company to deliver products based on Intel microprocessors in a timely manner; the continued availability on acceptable terms of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the ability of the Company to make timely delivery of new programs, products and successful technological innovations to the marketplace; the effect that product quality problems could have on the Company's sales and
operating profits; the inventory risk associated with the Company's need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party digital content; the Company's dependency on third-party software developers to timely develop future applications that support Intel microprocessors and Power PC microprocessors; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; and risks associated with the Company's retail initiative including significant investment cost, uncertain consumer acceptance and potential impact on existing reseller relationships. More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included from time to time in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC, including the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 24, 2005, the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarters ended December 31, 2005 and April 1, 2006 and the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2006 and Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2006 to be filed with the SEC.

The Company sold 11,052,000 iPods during the quarter, representing eight percent unit growth and three percent revenue growth over the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhone units sold were 6,892,000 compared to 1,119,000 in the year-ago-quarter.
""Apple just reported one of the best quarters in its history, with a spectacular performance by the iPhonewe sold more phones than RIM,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""We don't yet know how this economic downturn will affect Apple. But we're armed with the strongest product line in our history, the most talented employees and the best customers in our industry. And $25 billion of cash safely in the bank with zero debt.""
""We're very pleased to have grown revenue 35 percent and to have generated $9.1 billion in cash in fiscal 2008,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead, visibility is low and forecasting is challenging, and as a result we are going to be prudent in predicting the December quarter. We are providing a wide range for our guidance, targeting revenue of $9.0 to $10.0 billion and earnings per diluted share between $1.06 and $1.35.""

*Non-GAAP Financial Measures
During fiscal 2007, the Company began selling the iPhone and Apple TV. Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.
In July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined. As a result of this growth in unit sales, the amount of iPhone revenue and product cost that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting increased materially in the quarter ended September 27, 2008.
While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company's operations and financial position, management supplements its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: ""Adjusted Sales,"" ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin,"" ""Adjusted Operating Margin,"" ""Adjusted Income before Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share."" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.
Management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company's growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the significant increase in iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended September 27, 2008, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company's growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company's underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate on-going operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses.
Furthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures ""Adjusted Sales"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" are metrics that will factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Income before Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate on-going operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company's performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company's current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance. Beginning with this earnings release, the Company plans to include these non-GAAP measures of financial performance as part of its earnings releases.
Cautions on Use of Non-GAAP Measures
As noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not adjust for the costs associated with the Company's intention to provide unspecified new features and software to purchasers of iPhone and Apple TV products. These costs are expensed as incurred under GAAP's subscription accounting model, and are not adjusted in these non-GAAP financial measures. As such, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to reflect in a given period all of the costs of sales made in that period. Rather, the non-GAAP financial measures presented below are intended for the limited purpose of presenting performance measures that include the total sales, related product costs, and resulting income for iPhones and AppleTVs in the period those products are sold to customers.
Management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.
A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.
This press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company's reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company's gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company's need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party digital content; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company's sales and operating profits; the Company's reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; unfavorable results of other legal proceedings; and the Company's dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products. More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included from time to time in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC, including the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2007; its Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended December 29, 2007, March 29, 2008 and June 28, 2008; and its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, to be filed with the SEC. The Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.

Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.
In July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.
Unit sales of iPhone 3G continued to be significant in the quarter ended December 27, 2008, with 4.4 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company's operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: ""Adjusted Sales,"" ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin,"" ""Adjusted Operating Margin,"" ""Adjusted Income before Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Provision for Income Taxes,"" ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share.""

*Non-GAAP Financial Measures
During fiscal 2007, the Company began selling the iPhone and Apple TV. Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods sold during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.
In July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.
Unit sales of iPhone 3G continued to be significant in the quarter ended March 28, 2009, with 3.79 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company's operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: ""Adjusted Sales,"" ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin,"" ""Adjusted Operating Margin,"" ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share."" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The above-mentioned non-GAAP measures are generated by adjusting the related GAAP measures solely to reverse the effect of subscription accounting. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.
Management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company's growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the impact of iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended March 28, 2009, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company's growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company's underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses. Furthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures ""Adjusted Sales"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" are metrics that factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate ongoing operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company's performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company's current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance.
Cautions on Use of Non-GAAP Measures
As noted previously, these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. These non-GAAP financial measures do not adjust for the costs associated with the Company's intention to provide unspecified new features and software to purchasers of iPhone and Apple TV products. These costs are expensed as incurred under GAAP's subscription accounting model, and are not adjusted in these non-GAAP financial measures. As such, these non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to reflect in a given period all of the costs of sales made in that period. Rather, the non-GAAP financial measures presented below are intended for the limited purpose of presenting performance measures that include the total sales, related product costs, and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs in the period those products are sold to customers.
Management believes investors will benefit from greater transparency in referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that:
 
 
 
 
 
 
Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.
A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure or measures appears at the end of this press release.
This press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company's reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company's gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company's need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party digital content and applications; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company's sales and operating profits; the Company's reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; the continued service and availability of key executives and employees; unfavorable results of other legal proceedings; and the Company's dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products. More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included from time to time in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC, including the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2008, its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 27, 2008, and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2009 to be filed with the SEC.

Apple Reports Third Quarter Results
Best Non-Holiday Quarter Revenue and Earnings in Apple History
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJuly 21, 2009Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2009 third quarter ended June 27, 2009. The Company posted revenue of $8.34 billion and a net quarterly profit of $1.23 billion, or $1.35 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $7.46 billion and net quarterly profit of $1.07 billion, or $1.19 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 36.3 percent, up from 34.8 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 44 percent of the quarter's revenue.
In accordance with the subscription accounting treatment required by GAAP, the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for iPhone and Apple TV over their estimated economic lives. Adjusting GAAP sales and product costs to eliminate the impact of subscription accounting, the corresponding non-GAAP measures* for the quarter are $9.74 billion of ""Adjusted Sales"" and $1.94 billion of ""Adjusted Net Income.""
Apple sold 2.6 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a four percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 10.2 million iPods during the quarter, representing a seven percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter. Quarterly iPhones sold were 5.2 million, representing 626 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter.
""We're making our most innovative products ever and our customers are responding,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""We're thrilled to have sold over 5.2 million iPhones during the quarter and users have downloaded more than 1.5 billion applications from our App Store in its first year.""
""We're extremely pleased to report record non-holiday quarter revenue and earnings and quarterly cash flow from operations of $2.3 billion,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the fourth fiscal quarter of 2009, we expect revenue in the range of about $8.7 billion to $8.9 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $1.18 to $1.23.""
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q3 2009 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple's standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming. The live webcast will begin at 2:00 p.m. PDT on July 21, 2009 at and will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

*Non-GAAP Financial Measures
During fiscal 2007, the Company began selling iPhone and Apple TV. Because the Company may provide unspecified features and additional software products to iPhone and Apple TV customers in the future free of charge, in accordance with GAAP the Company recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for these products on a straight-line basis over their economic lives, with any loss recognized at the time of sale. Currently, the economic lives of these products are estimated to be 24 months. This accounting treatment, referred to as subscription accounting, results in the deferral of almost all of the revenue and cost of goods sold during the quarter in which the products are sold to the customer. Other costs related to these products, including costs for engineering, sales, marketing and warranty, are expensed as incurred. Further, the costs to develop any future unspecified features and additional software products that may eventually be provided to customers also are expensed as incurred. In contrast, the Company generally recognizes revenue and cost of goods sold for its other products, such as Macs and iPods, at the time of sale, as the Company does not provide future unspecified features or additional software products to those customers free of charge.
In July 2008, the Company began selling iPhone 3G, the second-generation iPhone, and at that time significantly expanded distribution by establishing carrier relationships in over 70 countries. Unit sales of iPhone 3G have been significantly greater than sales of the first-generation iPhone. During the first quarter of iPhone 3G availability ended September 27, 2008, 6.9 million units were sold, exceeding the 6.1 million first-generation iPhone units sold in the prior five quarters combined.
In June 2009, the Company began selling iPhone 3GS, the third-generation iPhone. Unit sales of iPhones continued to be significant in the quarter ended June 27, 2009, with 5.2 million iPhones sold. As a result, the amount of revenue and product cost related to those iPhone sales that the Company deferred for recognition in future periods under subscription accounting was substantial. While the GAAP results provide significant insight into the Company's operations and financial position, management continues to supplement its analysis of the business using financial measures that look at the total sales, related product costs and resulting income for iPhones and Apple TVs sold to customers during the period. The presentation at the end of this press release includes the following non-GAAP measures: ""Adjusted Sales,"" ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin,"" ""Adjusted Operating Margin,"" ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share."" These financial measures are not consistent with GAAP because they do not reflect the deferral of revenue and product costs for recognition in later periods. The above-mentioned non-GAAP measures are generated by adjusting the related GAAP measures solely to reverse the effect of subscription accounting. The Company uses these financial measures, along with other measures discussed below, to provide additional insight into current operating and business trends not readily apparent from the GAAP results.
Management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate the Company's growth rate, revenue mix and performance relative to competitors. Given the impact of iPhone unit sales during the quarter ended June 27, 2009, Adjusted Sales provides a meaningful measurement of the Company's growth by reflecting amounts generally due to Apple at the time of sale related to products sold within the period. Further, eliminating the effects of deferred revenue (current sales deferred to future periods and prior sales being recognized currently) provides more transparency into the Company's underlying sales trends. Management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Cost of Sales,"" ""Adjusted Gross Margin"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales and to facilitate ongoing operating decisions. Additionally, because the Company recognizes engineering, sales, and marketing expenses as incurred, including expenses related to iPhone and Apple TV, management uses Adjusted Sales to evaluate returns on those costs, to manage year-over-year operating expense growth, and to budget future expenses. Furthermore, because they are considered meaningful indicators of current business performance, the non-GAAP measures ""Adjusted Sales"" and ""Adjusted Operating Margin"" are metrics that factor into the determination of management compensation beginning in fiscal year 2009. Finally, management uses the non-GAAP measures of ""Adjusted Net Income"" and ""Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share"" to measure the Company's operating performance based on current period iPhone and Apple TV sales, to facilitate ongoing operating decisions, and compare performance relative to competitors.
Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding consolidated GAAP measures and related segment information, provide incremental insight into the underlying factors and trends affecting both the Company's performance and its cash generating potential. Management believes these non-GAAP measures increase the transparency of the Company's current results and enable investors to more fully understand trends in its current and future performance.

On January 25, 2010, Apple Inc. (""Apple"") issued a press release regarding Apple's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2009 and a related data sheet. A copy of Apple's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. A copy of the related data sheet is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. A copy of the selected quarterly financial schedules is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3.
On September 23, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") Issue 08-1 and EITF Issue 09-3, resulting in the issuance of accounting standard updates ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14. Apple was required to adopt the new accounting standards no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Apple elected to adopt the new standards during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as reflected in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2010. The Company also filed a Form 10-K/A to amend its Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009 solely to reflect the retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards to the periods presented in that report.
Additionally included in this Form 8-K are selected quarterly financial schedules reflecting the impact of retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards and reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheets, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These financial schedules are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and will also be available on the Company's website at .
www.apple.com/investor
The new accounting principles result in the Company's recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product cost for iPhone and Apple TV when those products are delivered to customers. Under historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product's estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.
Because Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, the Company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. The Company believes retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and better reflects the underlying performance of the Company's business.

Apple Reports First Quarter Results
All-Time Highest Revenue and Profit
New Accounting Standards Adopted
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJanuary 25, 2010Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2010 first quarter ended December 26, 2009. The Company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.9 percent, up from 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 58 percent of the quarter's revenue.
Apple sold 3.36 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a 33 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 8.7 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 100 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 21 million iPods during the quarter, representing an eight percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter Apple elected retrospective adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's amended accounting standards related to certain revenue recognition. Adoption of the new accounting standards significantly changes how the Company accounts for certain items, particularly sales of iPhone and Apple TV.
*
""If you annualize our quarterly revenue, it's surprising that Apple is now a $50+ billion company,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that we're really excited about.""
""We are very pleased to have generated $5.8 billion in cash during the quarter,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter of 2010, we expect revenue in the range of about $11.0 billion to $11.4 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $2.06 to $2.18.""

On January 25, 2010, Apple Inc. (""Apple"") issued a press release regarding Apple's financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended December 26, 2009 and a related data sheet. A copy of Apple's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1. A copy of the related data sheet is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.2. A copy of the selected quarterly financial schedules is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3.
On September 23, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (""EITF"") Issue 08-1 and EITF Issue 09-3, resulting in the issuance of accounting standard updates ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14. Apple was required to adopt the new accounting standards no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Apple elected to adopt the new standards during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as reflected in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2010. The Company also filed a Form 10-K/A to amend its Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009 solely to reflect the retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards to the periods presented in that report.
Additionally included in this Form 8-K are selected quarterly financial schedules reflecting the impact of retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards and reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheets, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These financial schedules are attached hereto as Exhibit 99.3 and will also be available on the Company's website at .
www.apple.com/investor
The new accounting principles result in the Company's recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product cost for iPhone and Apple TV when those products are delivered to customers. Under historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time-to-time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product's estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.
Because Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, the Company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. The Company believes retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and better reflects the underlying performance of the Company's business.
For additional information refer to the ""Explanatory Note"" in Apple's Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009.
 
The information contained in this Current Report shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Exchange Act, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.

Exhibit 99.1
Apple Reports First Quarter Results
All-Time Highest Revenue and Profit
New Accounting Standards Adopted
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJanuary 25, 2010Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2010 first quarter ended December 26, 2009. The Company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.9 percent, up from 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 58 percent of the quarter's revenue.
Apple sold 3.36 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a 33 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 8.7 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 100 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 21 million iPods during the quarter, representing an eight percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter Apple elected retrospective adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's amended accounting standards related to certain revenue recognition. Adoption of the new accounting standards significantly changes how the Company accounts for certain items, particularly sales of iPhone and Apple TV.

""If you annualize our quarterly revenue, it's surprising that Apple is now a $50+ billion company,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that we're really excited about.""
""We are very pleased to have generated $5.8 billion in cash during the quarter,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter of 2010, we expect revenue in the range of about $11.0 billion to $11.4 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $2.06 to $2.18.""
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2010 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple's standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming. The live webcast will begin at 2:00 p.m. PST on January 25, 2010 at and will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

Exhibit 99.1
Apple Reports First Quarter Results
All-Time Highest Revenue and Profit
New Accounting Standards Adopted
CUPERTINO, CaliforniaJanuary 25, 2010Apple today announced financial results for its fiscal 2010 first quarter ended December 26, 2009. The Company posted revenue of $15.68 billion and a net quarterly profit of $3.38 billion, or $3.67 per diluted share. These results compare to revenue of $11.88 billion and net quarterly profit of $2.26 billion, or $2.50 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin was 40.9 percent, up from 37.9 percent in the year-ago quarter. International sales accounted for 58 percent of the quarter's revenue.
Apple sold 3.36 million Macintosh computers during the quarter, representing a 33 percent unit increase over the year-ago quarter. The Company sold 8.7 million iPhones in the quarter, representing 100 percent unit growth over the year-ago quarter. Apple sold 21 million iPods during the quarter, representing an eight percent unit decline from the year-ago quarter.
During the quarter Apple elected retrospective adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's amended accounting standards related to certain revenue recognition. Adoption of the new accounting standards significantly changes how the Company accounts for certain items, particularly sales of iPhone and Apple TV.

""If you annualize our quarterly revenue, it's surprising that Apple is now a $50+ billion company,"" said Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO. ""The new products we are planning to release this year are very strong, starting this week with a major new product that we're really excited about.""
""We are very pleased to have generated $5.8 billion in cash during the quarter,"" said Peter Oppenheimer, Apple's CFO. ""Looking ahead to the second fiscal quarter of 2010, we expect revenue in the range of about $11.0 billion to $11.4 billion and we expect diluted earnings per share in the range of about $2.06 to $2.18.""
Apple will provide live streaming of its Q1 2010 financial results conference call utilizing QuickTime, Apple's standards-based technology for live and on-demand audio and video streaming. The live webcast will begin at 2:00 p.m. PST on January 25, 2010 at and will also be available for replay for approximately two weeks thereafter.

*Retrospective Adoption of Amended Accounting Standards
On September 23, 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue 08-1 and EITF Issue 09-3, resulting in the issuance of accounting standard updates ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14. Apple was required to adopt the new accounting standards no later than the first quarter of fiscal 2011. Apple elected to adopt the new standards during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, as reflected in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2009, which was filed with the SEC on January 25, 2010. The Company also filed a Form 10-K/A to amend its Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009 solely to reflect the retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards to the periods presented in that report. Additionally, Apple filed a Form 8-K that included selected quarterly financial schedules reflecting the impact of retrospective adoption of the new accounting standards and reconciling the application of old and new accounting principles to historical income statements, balance sheets, cash flow from operations, deferred revenue and summary data information. These financial schedules will also be available on the Company's website at www.apple.com/investor.
The new accounting principles result in the Company's recognition of substantially all of the revenue and product cost for iPhone and Apple TV when those products are delivered to customers. Under historical accounting principles, the Company was required to account for sales of both iPhone and Apple TV using subscription accounting because the Company indicated it might from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades and features for those products free of charge. Under subscription accounting, revenue and associated product cost of sales for iPhone and Apple TV were deferred at the time of sale and recognized on a straight-line basis over each product's estimated economic life. This resulted in the deferral of significant amounts of revenue and cost of sales related to iPhone and Apple TV.
Because Apple began selling both iPhone and Apple TV in fiscal 2007, the Company retrospectively adopted the new accounting principles as if the new accounting principles had been applied in all prior periods. Consequently, the financial results of each quarter from fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2009 have been revised. The Company believes retrospective adoption provides analysts and investors the most comparable and useful financial information and better reflects the underlying performance of the Company's business.
For additional information refer to the ""Explanatory Note"" in Apple's Amendment No. 1 to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 26, 2009.
This press release contains forward-looking statements including without limitation those about the Company's estimated revenue and earnings per share. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ. Risks and uncertainties include without limitation the effect of competitive and economic factors, and the Company's reaction to those factors, on consumer and business buying decisions with respect to the Company's products; continued competitive pressures in the marketplace; the ability of the Company to deliver to the marketplace and stimulate customer demand for new programs, products, and technological innovations on a timely basis; the effect that product transitions, changes in product pricing or mix, and/or increases in component costs could have on the Company's gross margin; the inventory risk associated with the Company's need to order or commit to order product components in advance of customer orders; the continued availability on acceptable terms, or at all, of certain components and services essential to the Company's business currently obtained by the Company from sole or limited sources; the effect that the Company's dependency on manufacturing and logistics services provided by third parties may have on the quality, quantity or cost of products manufactured or services rendered; the Company's reliance on the availability of third-party digital content and applications; the potential impact of a finding that the Company has infringed on the intellectual property rights of others; the Company's dependency on the performance of distributors and other resellers of the Company's products; the effect that product and service quality problems could have on the Company's sales and operating profits; the Company's reliance on sole service providers for iPhone in certain countries; the continued service and availability of key executives and employees; war, terrorism, public health issues, and other circumstances that could disrupt supply, delivery, or demand of products; potential litigation from the matters investigated by the special committee of the board of directors and the restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements; and unfavorable results of other legal proceedings. More information on potential factors that could affect the Company's financial results is included from time to time in the Company's public reports filed with the SEC, including the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 26, 2009 and its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended December 26, 2009.

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 17, 2004  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.89 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2004, 24 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.83 billion, 25 percent ahead of last year. Second quarter GAAP net earnings were $104 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $146 million, or $0.31 per share, in last year's second quarter.
 
Excluding $15 million of net restructuring and amortization charges, Agilent reported second quarter operating net income of $119 million, or $0.24 per share, versus a loss on a comparable basis of $72 million, or $0.15 per share, one year ago.
 
""Agilent's businesses are clearly picking up, with virtually all of our major markets and all geographies gaining momentum,"" said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""Orders and revenue were at their highest levels since early 2001. Operating earnings per share
(1)
of 24 cents were near the top end of our guidance range  three cents better than the first quarter and 39 cents above last year.""
 
For the third consecutive quarter, Agilent generated positive free cash flow from operations
(2)
. The company ended the quarter with $1.84 billion of cash and equivalents, up $164 million from the prior quarter. Inventory days-on-hand improved by 21 from one year ago to 94. Receivables days sales outstanding improved by 3 from one year ago to 54. Capital spending of $35 million was $32 million below the level of depreciation.
 
""Given our strong orders and revenues, our performance on the bottom line could have been even better,"" said Barnholt. ""With our markets clearly on the upswing, our market shares stable or rising, and our fundamental cost structure firmly in place, Agilent's remaining challenge is to demonstrate superior performance on the bottom line. We intend to make significant progress against that commitment during the second half of this year.""
 
For the seasonally soft third quarter, Agilent expects revenues of $1.80 billion to $1.90 billion, roughly in line with second quarter results. Operating earnings should be in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share
(3)
compared to the second quarter's $0.24. During the fourth quarter, the company currently anticipates revenues to be roughly $50 million above the third quarter and operating earnings per share to be up an additional $0.05.
Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
Second quarter Test and Measurement orders of $745 million were 23 percent above one year ago and up 16 percent from the seasonally soft first quarter. Compared to last year, orders were up in all geographies and all markets except wireline telecommunications. Revenues of $705 million were 8 percent above last year and 10 percent ahead of three months earlier.
 
Second quarter operating profits of $11 million were improved by $114 million compared to one year ago on a $53 million increase in revenues because of the cumulative benefits of aggressive restructuring. Profits were up $7 million versus the first quarter on a revenue gain of $63 million because of disappointing results in systems and support businesses. Actions now under way to address these performance issues are expected to enable segment operating margins to reach double-digit levels by the fourth quarter of this year.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
Second quarter Automated Test orders of $286 million were 31 percent above one year ago and at the highest level since 2000, with significant year-to-year growth in all product lines. Sequentially, orders were up 43 percent from the seasonally weak first quarter. Revenues of $266 million were 74 percent above last year and up 21 percent from the first quarter. The segment book-to-bill was 1.08 compared to 1.43 one year ago and 0.91 in the first quarter.
 
Segment profits of $34 million were up $71 million from one year ago on a $113 million increase in revenues, an attractive 63 percent incremental performance. Return on invested capital (ROIC) during the quarter was about 16 percent
(5)
.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
The top line of Semiconductor Products was very strong again in the second quarter. Orders of $523 million were up 25 percent from last year, with Personal Systems orders up 35 percent while Networking Systems orders were about flat with last year's levels. Second quarter revenues of $527 million were 40 percent above one year ago compared to a 32 percent increase in worldwide semiconductor industry shipments through March.
 
Segment profits of $65 million were $108 million better than last year on a $151 million increase in sales. Sequentially, profits improved $5 million on a $58 million increase in revenues as the business invested to meet strong demand for new mobile and consumer products and experienced cost pressures in Networking Systems. Nonetheless, the segment generated a very attractive 34 percent ROIC during the quarter
(5)
.
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in millions)
 
 
The cyclical rebound in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis continued to build momentum in the second quarter.

Revenues of $333 million were also at record levels, up 16 percent above last year.
 
Segment profits reached $39 million in the quarter, up $19 million from one year ago on a $47 million increase in revenues. Profits were off $10 million from the first quarter because of the normal seasonal increase in expenses. During the quarter, the segment achieved an ROIC of 21 percent

Exhibit 99.1
 
 
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 12, 2004  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.78 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2004, 21 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.89 billion, 25 percent ahead of last year. Third quarter GAAP net earnings were $100 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, compared to a loss of $1.56 billion, or $3.28 per share, in last year's third quarter.
 
Excluding $54 million of net restructuring and amortization charges, Agilent reported third quarter operating net income of $154 million, or $0.30 per share. On a comparable basis, but also excluding a $1.45 billion non-cash charge related to the write-off of deferred tax assets, the company had a loss last year of $11 million, or $0.02 per share.
 
""We are pleased with Agilent's third quarter results,"" said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""Revenues, at $1.89 billion, were near the top of our expectations while operating earnings
(1)
hit the top end of our guidance range at $0.30 per share.
 
""Our Test and Measurement segment performance was particularly strong, with orders up 37 percent to the highest level since early 2001 and revenues 25 percent above last year. We achieved our commitment to reach double-digit operating margins in this segment one quarter ahead of plan, with a third quarter margin of 11 percent.""
 
For the fourth consecutive quarter, Agilent generated positive free cash flow from operations
(2)
. The company ended the quarter with $1.94 billion of cash and equivalents, up $95 million from the prior quarter. Inventory days-on-hand improved by 16 from one year ago to a new low of 91. Receivables days sales outstanding improved by 3 to 55. Capital spending of $26 million was $39 million below the level of depreciation. Compared to the second quarter, total operating expenses were reduced by $22 million.
 
Looking to Agilent's fiscal fourth quarter, Barnholt said, ""We are pleased with the sustained momentum we are seeing in our Test and Measurement and our Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis segments. But, we are also seeing a pause in Agilent's semiconductor and semiconductor equipment businesses that may continue through year-end before we see renewed growth in fiscal 2005.
 
""On balance, we remain comfortable with Agilent's prior fourth quarter guidance for revenues of $1.85 billion to $1.95 billion and operating earnings of $0.30 to $0.35 per share

Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
Third quarter Test and Measurement orders of $776 million were 37 percent above one year ago to the highest level since the second quarter of 2001. Orders in all geographies and all markets were up, including the first year-to-year improvement in wireline test in several years. Revenues of $768 million were 25 percent above last year and 9 percent ahead of three months earlier.
 
Third quarter operating profits of $88 million were improved by $157 million compared to one year ago on a $155 million increase in revenues because of the cumulative benefits of aggressive restructuring and lower levels of discounts. Compared to the second quarter, segment profits were up $77 million on a $63 million increase in revenues due to better gross margins, lower operating expenses and an improvement in the systems and support businesses. During the quarter, Test and Measurement achieved a 14 percent return on invested capital
(5)
(ROIC), up from 1 percent in the second quarter and (6) percent one year ago.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
Third quarter Automated Test orders of $208 million were down 17 percent from one year ago, with strength in parametric and manufacturing test more than offset by year-to-year declines in orders for system on a chip (SOC) and flash memory test systems. Utilization rates for SOC testers at semiconductor contract manufacturers (SCMs) dropped several percentage points in the third quarter, suggesting a period of semiconductor industry digestion and cautious ordering that could last through the fourth quarter of this year. Revenues of $243 million were 18 percent above last year but down 9 percent sequentially.
 
Segment profits of $19 million were up $13 million from one year ago on a $37 million increase in revenues. Over the year, segment R&D spending increased 16 percent as the company continues to aggressively expand the breadth of its offerings in flash and SOC test systems. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 8 percent during the quarter compared to 2 percent one year ago and 12 percent in the second quarter.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products orders continued to show strong year-to-year gains, with third quarter orders of $470 million, up 31 percent from last year. Sequentially, orders were off 10 percent due to normal seasonal weakness and an industry inventory rebuilding that appears to have been completed. Personal systems orders were up 43 percent from last year but down 13 percent sequentially as the maturing semiconductor cycle begins to exhibit the normal seasonal patterns of a consumer-focused business. Networking systems orders were 8 percent above one year ago and down 3 percent sequentially. Third quarter revenues of $539 million were 42 percent above last year compared to a 40 percent increase in worldwide semiconductor industry shipments through June.
 
Segment profits of $33 million were $41 million better than last year on a $159 million improvement in sales. Sequentially, profits were down $32 million on a $12 million increase in revenues. During the quarter, the business experienced severe price pressures in mobile camera modules and fiber optics. Actions are now under way to restore segment operating margins to double digits in the first half of fiscal 2005. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 15 percent during the quarter compared to (1) percent one year ago and 26 percent during the second quarter.
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in millions)
 
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis continued to show good momentum in the third quarter. Orders of $321 million were 10 percent above last year, with Life Sciences orders up 5 percent and Chemical Analysis up 13 percent. Revenues of $335 million were an all-time record and 11 percent above last year.
 
Segment profits reached $46 million in the quarter, up $5 million from last year's excellent operating results on a $32 million increase in revenues as the company continued to invest in new life sciences solutions. Profits were up $7 million from the second quarter because of seasonally lower expenses. During the quarter, the segment achieved an ROIC
(5)
of 23 percent, compared with last year's ROIC of 22 percent and 16 percent in the second quarter.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 14, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.61 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2005, 7 percent below one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.66 billion, 1 percent ahead of last year. First quarter GAAP net earnings were $103 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $71 million, or $0.14 per share, in last year's first quarter.
 
Excluding a net $3 million of restructuring charges and tax benefits, Agilent reported first quarter operating net income of $100 million, or $0.20 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $103 million, or $0.21 per share, one year ago.
(1)
 
""I am pleased with Agilent's first quarter performance,"" said Ned Barnholt, Agilent chairman, president and chief executive officer. ""We executed well, with very good operating discipline and cash generation in a challenging market environment. This quarter we continued to build on our strong foundation of product innovation and operational excellence that I believe will benefit Agilent for years to come.""
 
The company reported first quarter revenues of $1.66 billion, consistent with its expectations of $1.60 billion to $1.70 billion. Operating earnings, at $0.20 per share, were at the top of the guidance range of $0.14 to $0.21 per share. Gross margins were essentially flat compared with last year, despite much more difficult conditions in Agilent's semiconductor-related businesses, and operating expenses remained under very good control. The company generated another $100 million in free cash flow
(2)
from operations during the quarter, bringing total cash on hand to $2.5 billion.""
 
Looking ahead, Agilent said it expects relatively flat second quarter fiscal 2005 revenues of $1.60 billion to $1.70 billion, reflecting the $70 million lower revenues associated with the divestiture of the company's camera module business. Operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share

Segment Results
 
Test and Measurement
(in millions)
 
 
First quarter Test and Measurement orders of $652 million were 3 percent above one year ago and down 5 percent from the seasonally strong fourth quarter. Overall segment demand was characterized by continued softness in wireless handset manufacturing test, stabilizing wireline test markets, and generally flat general purpose test orders. Revenues of $700 million were 10 percent above last year and down 10 percent from three months earlier due to continued softness in wireless handset manufacturing test.
First quarter operating profits of $63 million were improved by $58 million compared with one year ago on a $63 million increase in revenues. Compared with the fourth quarter, segment profits were down $54 million on an $82 million drop in revenues. During the quarter, Test and Measurement achieved a 12 percent Return On Invested Capital
(5)
(ROIC), up from 2 percent last year but down from 19 percent in last year's fourth quarter.
 
Automated Test
(in millions)
 
 
First quarter Automated Test orders of $160 million were down 20 percent from one year ago but up 17 percent sequentially. Compared with last year, all product lines were weaker except parametric test; sequentially, all product lines were up except manufacturing test. Utilization rates for SOC testers at semiconductor contract manufacturers (SCMs) improved for the second consecutive quarter, and averaged about 92 percent during the quarter. While the rebound is expected to be very slow because of excess overall industry capacity, last year's fourth quarter may prove to be the bottom for Automated Test orders. Revenues of $155 million were 29 percent below last year and down 21 percent sequentially. Automated Test's book-to-bill ratio rose to 1.03 in the quarter from 0.91 last year and 0.70 one quarter earlier.
 
The segment had an operating loss of $34 million during the quarter compared with profits of $21 million one year ago on $64 million lower revenues. Sequentially, profits were down $28 million on a $41 million reduction in revenues. During the quarter, gross margins were depressed by lower volumes and intense competitive pressures. Operating expenses were relatively flat year-to-year. Acceptance of the company's new generation of flash memory and SOC test systems has been encouraging, with 90 percent of flash memory test and 16 percent of SOC orders now coming from new products.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products orders were $435 million during the first quarter, down 26 percent from one year ago but up 7 percent sequentially. Compared with last year, orders declined virtually across the board. Personal systems components orders were off 30 percent from last year, with particular weakness in optical mice; networking systems components were down 16 percent from last year. Sequentially, personal systems components were up 6 percent and networking systems components were up 7 percent. First quarter revenues of $450 million were 5 percent below last year and down 9 percent sequentially. The book-to-bill for Semiconductor Products improved to 0.97 in the first quarter compared with 0.83 three months ago but remained well below last year's 1.24.
 
Segment profits of $27 million were $33 million below last year on a $24 million drop in revenues; margins suffered as the industry moved from shortage to surplus. Sequentially, profits were $19 million higher despite $42 million lower revenues as both camera modules and fiber optics showed significant improvements in quality, yield and cost compared with the second half of last year. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 10 percent during the quarter compared with 23 percent one year ago and 6 percent during the fourth quarter.
 
On Feb. 3, 2005, the company announced it had completed the sale of its camera module business to Flextronics.
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in millions)
 
Good momentum in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis continued in this year's first quarter. Orders of $356 million were 16 percent above last year, with Life Sciences orders up 18 percent and Chemical Analysis up 15 percent. During the quarter, the segment saw particular strength from generic drug manufacturers, and strong demand from petrochemical and environmental industries. Revenues of $354 million were 13 percent above last year and up 1 percent sequentially.
 
Segment profits of $51 million were $4 million above last year on a $41 million increase in revenues as the segment continued to ramp its investments in Life Sciences. Sustained profits and excellent capital management enabled the segment to achieve an ROIC
(5)
of 29 percent during the quarter compared with last year's ROIC of 23 percent and 24 percent in the fourth quarter.

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 16, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.73 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2005, 9 percent below one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.69 billion, 8 percent below last year. Second quarter GAAP net earnings were $95 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, compared with $104 million, or $0.21 per share, in last year's second quarter.
 
Excluding a net $6 million composed largely of restructuring charges and tax benefits, Agilent reported second quarter operating net income of $101 million, or $0.20 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $119 million, or $0.24 per share, one year ago.
(1)
 
""Agilent had a solid second quarter performance,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""We demonstrated operational discipline and excellent cash generation in very challenging markets. As the world's premier measurement company, we also continued to build upon our strong foundation of innovation, with new product introductions that will extend Agilent's market and technology leadership.""
 
The company reported second quarter revenues of $1.69 billion, consistent with its expectations of $1.60 billion to $1.70 billion. Operating earnings, at $0.20 per share, were also within the guidance range of $0.18 to $0.23 per share. Gross margins improved by 2 percentage points compared with last year, despite 8 percent lower revenues and more difficult conditions in many of Agilent's markets. Operating expenses remained under good control. During the quarter, the company generated approximately $160 million in free cash flow
(2)
from operations, bringing total cash on hand to $2.7 billion.
 
Looking ahead, Agilent said it expects third quarter fiscal 2005 revenues of $1.70 billion to $1.80 billion, with the beginning of a modest rebound in its semiconductor-related businesses offsetting the company's normally weak third quarter seasonality. Operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.23 to $0.28 per share
(3)
. As for the fourth quarter, normal fourth quarter seasonality would suggest a range of revenues about 5 percent above the third quarter and an increase in operating earnings of about $0.10 per share
(3)
.
 
Segment Results
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in $ millions)
 
 
Momentum in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis eased a bit in this year's second quarter. While orders of $385 million were 14 percent above last year, February and March were relatively soft and a surge in April orders
came late in the month. As a result, revenue of $344 million was up only 3 percent compared with last year. Life Sciences orders were up 17 percent, with strength in both large pharmaceuticals and generic drug manufacturers, while Chemical Analysis orders were up 11 percent compared with last year.
 
Segment profits of $39 million were above last year on an $11 million increase in revenues. Compared with one year ago, gross margins improved by nearly 3 percentage points but were offset by higher investments in Life Sciences. Sustained profits, a lower tax rate and excellent capital management enabled the segment to achieve a Return On Invested Capital
(5)
(ROIC) of 22 percent during the quarter compared with last year's ROIC of 15 percent.
 
Test and Measurement
(in $ millions)
 
 
Second quarter Test and Measurement orders of $757 million were 2 percent above one year ago and up 16 percent from the seasonally weak first quarter. Overall segment demand was characterized by a stabilizing market for wireless handset manufacturing test, growth in wireline test markets, and robust demand for Agilent's line of oscilloscopes and logic analyzers. Revenues of $748 million were 7 percent above last year and the prior three months.
 
Second quarter operating profits of $72 million were improved by $60 million compared with one year ago on a $48 million increase in revenues, demonstrating the continuing benefits of past years' restructuring programs. Compared with the first quarter, segment profits were up $9 million on a $48 million increase in revenues while segment expenses increased seasonally. During the quarter, Test and Measurement achieved a 15 percent ROIC, up from 1 percent last year and 3 points above the first quarter because of higher profits and significant improvements in capital management.
 
Automated Test
(in $ millions)
 
 
Second quarter Automated Test orders were up for the second consecutive quarter at $171 million, 7 percent above the first quarter and 25 percent above last year's fourth quarter trough. However, compared with last year's second quarter peak, this quarter's orders are still down 40 percent, with all product lines off. Sequentially, the picture is mixed, with SOC and manufacturing test up but flash memory and parametric test lower. While the rebound is expected to be very slow because of excess overall industry capacity, the recovery is expected to continue and broaden during this year's second half, given the excellent customer acceptance of Agilent's new SOC, flash, and manufacturing test products. Revenues of $181 million were 32 percent below last year but up 17 percent sequentially.
 
The second quarter segment loss of $20 million represents an improvement of $14 million compared with the first quarter on a $26 million increase in revenues. Gross margins improved during the quarter in part due to new product acceptance. Versus last year, profits are down $55 million on an $85 million revenue decline because of lower volumes and intense competitive pressures. Operating expenses were relatively flat year-to-year to support the new product introductions.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in $ millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products orders of $464 million during the second quarter were up 5 percent from one year ago and up 22 percent sequentially. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 compared with 1.00 in the first quarter and 0.97
one year ago, it appears that the inventory-related adjustment to semiconductor production has been largely completed. Personal systems components orders were up 2 percent from last year, with particular strength in optical mice offsetting some weakness in handset-related components. Networking systems components were up 11 percent from last year, led by gains in fiber optics and storage components. Second quarter revenues of $414 million were 9 percent below last year and up 9 percent sequentially.
 
Segment profits of $12 million were $38 million below last year on a $43 million drop in revenues. Margins continued to suffer from lower volumes and competitive pressures as the industry worked through its inventory adjustment. Sequentially, profits were $3 million lower on a $33 million increase in revenues as mix shifted to lower margin products. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 6 percent during the quarter compared with 21 percent one year ago; compared with the first quarter, ROIC was the same.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Aug. 15, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.80 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2005, 1 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.69 billion, 10 percent below last year. Third quarter GAAP net earnings were $104 million, or $0.21 per diluted share, compared with $100 million, or $0.20 per share, in last year's third quarter.
 
Excluding a net $38 million composed largely of restructuring charges and tax benefits, Agilent reported third quarter operating net income of $142 million, or $0.28 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $154 million, or $0.30 per share, one year ago
(1)
.
 
""Agilent performed well in the third quarter, despite still-soft markets,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Revenues were slightly below our expectations because of weak wireless test and life sciences markets. We were disciplined in our spending, however, and demonstrated excellent cash generation once again. As the world's premier measurement company, we extended our leadership through major new product introductions in both electronic and bioanalytical instrumentation.""
 
The company reported third quarter revenues of $1.69 billion, just below its expectations of $1.70 billion to $1.80 billion. Operating earnings, at $0.28 per share, were at the high end of expectations of $0.23 to $0.28 per share. Gross margins improved by over 2 percentage points compared with last year, despite 10 percent lower revenues and difficult conditions in several of Agilent's markets. During the quarter, the company generated $85 million in free cash flow
(2)
from operations, bringing total cash on hand to $2.8 billion.
 
Looking ahead, Agilent said it remained comfortable with its prior guidance for the fourth fiscal quarter. With evidence of a rebound in semiconductor-related markets, signs of a bottoming in wireless test, and the assumption of normal seasonality, the company expects fourth quarter fiscal 2005 revenues of $1.79 billion to $1.89 billion. Operating earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.33 to $0.38 per share

.
 
Segment Results
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis
(in $ millions)
 
 
Momentum in Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis remained mixed in this year's third quarter. Orders of $348 million were 8 percent above last year, and down 10 percent sequentially due to normal seasonal patterns. Both
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis orders were up similar amounts compared with last year, with particular strength in Life Sciences from generic drug manufacturers, and for the new gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) platforms within Chemical Analysis. Revenue of $341 million was up only 2 percent versus last year because of the late-quarter introduction of new GC/MS instruments and some weakness in near-term pharmaceutical demand. With shippable backlog at record levels, this segment is expected to return to double-digit revenue growth in Q4.
 
Segment profits of $42 million were $3 million below last year on a $6 million increase in revenues. Excluding the impact of recent acquisitions, profits were flat compared with last year. A lower tax rate and tight capital management enabled the segment to achieve a Return On Invested Capital
(5)
(ROIC) of 27 percent during the quarter, compared with last year's ROIC of 22 percent.
 
Test and Measurement
(in $ millions)
 
 
Third quarter Test and Measurement orders of $722 million were 6 percent below one year ago and down 5 percent from the seasonally strong second quarter. Overall segment demand was characterized by mixed demand in communications test solutions, with wireless test still below last year and wireline test up, and pockets of strength in general purpose instruments. Revenues of $705 million were 8 percent below last year and down 6 percent from the prior three months.
 
Third quarter operating profits of $72 million were $17 million below last year on $58 million lower revenues, with gross margins improved by over 1 point and operating expenses slightly below one year ago. Compared with the second quarter, segment profits were flat despite $43 million lower revenues. During the quarter, Test and Measurement achieved a 17 percent ROIC
(5)
, up 3 points from last year despite a 1.5 point lower operating margin, with taxes lower and capital investment well contained.
 
Automated Test
(in $ millions)
 
 
Third quarter Automated Test orders were up for the third consecutive quarter, reaching $228 million, 10 percent above last year and 33 percent ahead of the second quarter. Semiconductor test orders were up 18 percent from last year, with particular strength in SOC test, while manufacturing test orders were off 16 percent from one year ago. Revenues of $192 million were 21 percent below last year but up 6 percent sequentially. Segment book-to-bill of 1.19 compares with 0.86 one year ago and 0.94 in the second quarter.
 
The third quarter segment loss of $13 million represents an improvement of $7 million compared with the second quarter on an $11 million increase in revenues. With momentum building in semiconductor test, this segment is expected to return to profitability in the fourth quarter.
 
Semiconductor Products
(in $ millions)
 
 
Semiconductor Products orders of $499 million during the third quarter were up 25 percent from one year ago and up 8 percent sequentially. The increase in orders was led by personal systems, up 37 percent from last year, with particular strength in wireless handset components and navigation products, while networking orders were up 2
percent. With a book-to-bill ratio of 1.11 compared with 1.12 in the second quarter and only 0.87 one year ago, it appears that the semiconductor industry is regaining momentum. Third quarter revenues of $450 million were 2 percent below last year but up 9 percent sequentially.
 
Segment profits of $39 million were $2 million below last year on an $8 million drop in revenues. Sequentially, profits were up $27 million on a $36 million increase in revenues. Segment ROIC
(5)
was 18 percent during the quarter, flat with last year but up 12 points from the second quarter.

Semiconductor Products Group Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On August 14, 2005, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the ""Asset Purchase Agreement"") with Argos Acquisition Pte. Ltd. providing for the sale of substantially all of the assets of Agilent's Semiconductor Products Group (""SPG""). Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, the purchase price payable for SPG will be U.S. $2.66 billion, subject to adjustment based on a determination of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Asset Purchase Agreement) and working capital at closing. The transaction is subject to antitrust approvals and other customary closing conditions.
 
A copy of the Asset Purchase Agreement is included herein as Exhibit 2.1 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Asset Purchase Agreement.
 
Lumileds Share Purchase Agreement
 
On August 12, 2005, Agilent entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the ""Share Purchase Agreement"") with Agilent LED International, Philips Lumileds Holding B.V. and Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. (""Philips"") pursuant to which Agilent agreed to sell its stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. (""Lumileds"") to Philips.
 
Lumileds is a global joint venture between Agilent and Philips under a Second Amended and Restated Joint Venture Agreement (the ""Joint Venture Agreement""), dated as of November 29, 2004, between Agilent and Philips. Lumileds develops, manufactures and sells LEDs, modules, products and systems for a broad spectrum of lighting applications, including automotive lighting, high-brightness traffic signals, contour lighting and signs, outdoor illumination and white LEDs for both indoor and outdoor applications. Pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement, as of the closing of the transaction the Joint Venture Agreement and the ancillary agreements will be terminated.
 
The purchase price payable by Philips to Agilent under the Share Purchase Agreement is U.S. $948.5 million. Lumileds will also repay approximately $51.5 million in outstanding debt due to Agilent under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 31, 2001, by and among Lumileds, Philips, Agilent and Agilent Technologies Coordination Center S.C./C.V. The transaction is subject to antitrust approval.
 
A copy of the Share Purchase Agreement is included herein as Exhibit 2.2 and is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Share Purchase Agreement.
 
 
On August 15, 2005, Agilent announced a restructuring plan to reduce its Global Infrastructure costs by more than $450 million, and infrastructure-related employment by about 1,300 jobs. This reduction will be accomplished through a combination of employee transfers to the divestiture and spin-off, attrition and work force reduction. Agilent expects this restructuring to be largely completed around the middle of fiscal year 2006, and the roughly $200 million implementation cost to be essentially offset by the proceeds of property and other asset sales.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, the completion of divestitures and Agilent's expected restructuring and the reduction of infrastructure costs following their completion.
 
These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to risks associated with the ability to effect the divestitures on a timely basis, risks associated with changes in demand for Agilent's products and risks associated with the development generally of Agilent's overall strategic objectives.
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties on our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended April 30, 2005. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

(i) Purchaser shall be entitled to occupy the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property as a licensee upon the terms and conditions contained in the Lease with Seller or its Subsidiary with respect to such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property.

In either such event, Seller may terminate the license by delivering written notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall vacate the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property immediately or by such other date as may be specified in a notice served by Seller, except that with respect to Business Significant Real Property, the Seller shall, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into the Multi-Site License with respect to such Business Significant Real Property.

provisions of Section 2.2(b) hereof, observe and perform all of the covenants, obligations and conditions of Seller or such Subsidiary contained in the relevant Lease of the Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property and (C) indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Party from and against all Seller Losses arising on account of any breach thereof by Purchaser, other than Seller Losses incurred as a result of a Lease Enforcement Action with respect to any breach by Seller or its Subsidiaries of the relevant Lease by permitting Purchaser to occupy the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property without obtaining consent.
 
(c) If, despite the efforts of the Parties as set forth above, a Landlord of an Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property other than a Business Critical Real Property formally and unconditionally refuses to consent to the applicable assignment or sublease and provides written notice stating that Purchaser's occupancy violates the Lease with respect to such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property:
 
(i) With respect to any such Assigned Real Property, without limiting the rights of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries as set forth in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) below, Seller may, by written notice to Purchaser elect to apply to the relevant Landlord for consent to sublease to Purchaser all of the Assigned Real Property for the remainder of the relevant Lease term at a rent equal to the rent from time to time under the relevant Lease, and otherwise on substantially the same terms and conditions as the relevant Lease and pursuant to the terms of a reasonable sublease form prepared by Seller or such Subsidiary. If Seller makes such an election after the Closing Date (or before the Closing Date, if the Landlord consent is not received before the Closing Date), the provisions of Section 2.6(b) will apply; that upon receipt of the consent required to sublease the relevant Assigned Real Property, Seller shall, or shall cause such Subsidiary to sublease to Purchaser the Assigned Real Property as set forth herein. If Seller makes such an election before the Closing Date and the relevant Lease consent is obtained before the Closing Date, Seller shall sublease to Purchaser the relevant Assigned Real Property on the Closing Date as set forth above.

In such case, on the Closing Date, Seller shall not assign or sublease such Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property to Purchaser.
 
(iii) If Purchaser is occupying the applicable Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property as set forth in Section 2.6(b), Seller may elect by written notice to Purchaser to require Purchaser to vacate the relevant Assigned Real Property or Subleased Real Property, other than a Business Significant Real Property, immediately or by such other date as may be specified in the notice served by Seller as set forth in Section 2.6(b).
 
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained herein, the provisions of Section 2.6(b) and Section 2.6(c) shall not apply with respect to the Assigned Real

4.1 TRADEMARK USAGE GUIDELINES. Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Authorized Dealers shall use the Licensed Marks during the Term only in a manner that is consistent with the Trademark Usage Guidelines.
 
4.2 TRADEMARK REVIEWS. At Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser agrees to furnish or make available for inspection to Seller samples of all Licensed Products, Collateral Materials and Marketing Materials of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries that are marked with one or more of the Licensed Marks. Purchaser further agrees to take reasonably appropriate measures to require its Authorized Dealers to furnish or make available for inspection to
 
Purchaser samples of all Marketing Materials and Collateral Materials of its Authorized Dealers. If Purchaser is notified or reasonably determines that it or any of its Subsidiaries or Authorized Dealers is not complying with any Trademark Usage Guidelines, it shall notify Seller and the provisions of Article V and Section 3.3 hereof shall apply to such noncompliance.
 
 
5.1 INITIAL CURE PERIOD. If Seller becomes aware that Purchaser or any Subsidiary is not complying with any Trademark Usage Guidelines, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail a written description of the noncompliance and any requested action for curing such noncompliance. Purchaser shall then have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (""Guideline Initial Cure Period"") to correct such noncompliance or submit to Seller a written plan to correct such noncompliance, which written plan is reasonably acceptable to Seller, unless Seller previously affirmatively concurs in writing, in its sole discretion, that Purchaser or its Subsidiary is not in noncompliance. If Seller or Purchaser becomes aware that an Authorized Dealer is not complying with any Trademark Usage Guidelines, Purchaser (but not Seller) shall promptly notify such Authorized Dealer in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail a written description of the noncompliance and any requested action for curing such noncompliance. Such Authorized Dealer shall then have the Guideline Initial Cure Period to correct such noncompliance or submit to Purchaser a written plan to correct such noncompliance, which written plan is reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and Seller.
 
5.2 SECOND CURE PERIOD. If the noncompliance with the Trademark Usage Guidelines continues beyond the Guideline Initial Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly appoint a representative to negotiate in good faith actions that may be necessary to correct such noncompliance. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the Guideline Initial Cure Period to agree on corrective actions, and Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of an agreement of corrective actions to implement such corrective actions and cure or cause the cure of such noncompliance (""Second Guideline Cure Period"").
 
5.3 FINAL CURE PERIOD. If the noncompliance with the Trademark Usage Guidelines by Purchaser or any Subsidiary (as the case may be) remains uncured after the expiration of the Second Guideline Cure Period, then at Seller's election, Purchaser or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) promptly shall cease using the non-complying Collateral Materials until Seller reasonably determines that Purchaser or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) has demonstrated its ability and commitment to comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines. If the noncompliance with the Trademark Usage Guidelines by an Authorized Dealer remains uncured after the expiration of the Second Guideline Cure Period, then at Purchaser's election, such Authorized Dealer promptly shall cease using the non-complying Collateral Materials and/or Marketing Materials until Purchaser determines that such Authorized Dealer has demonstrated its ability and commitment to comply with the Trademark Usage Guidelines. Nothing in this Article V shall be deemed to limit Purchaser's obligations under Section 3.3 above or to preclude Seller from exercising any rights or remedies under Section 3.3 above.
 
 
6.1 GENERAL. Purchaser acknowledges that the Licensed Products permitted by this License to be marked with one or more of the Licensed Marks must continue to be of sufficiently high quality as to provide protection of the Licensed Marks and the goodwill they symbolize.
 
6.2 QUALITY STANDARDS. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries shall use the Licensed Marks only on and in connection with Licensed Products that meet or exceed in all respects the Quality Standards.
 
6.3 QUALITY CONTROL REVIEWS. At Seller's reasonable request, Purchaser agrees to furnish or make available to Seller for inspection sample Licensed Products marked with one or more of the Licensed Marks. If Purchaser is notified or reasonably determines that it or any of its Subsidiaries is not complying with any Quality Standards, it shall notify Seller and the provisions of Article VII and Section 2.3 shall apply to such noncompliance.
 
 
7.1 INITIAL CURE PERIOD. If Seller becomes aware that Purchaser or any Subsidiary is not complying with any Quality Standard, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing, setting forth in reasonable detail a written description of the noncompliance and any requested action for curing such noncompliance. Following receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall make an inquiry promptly and in good faith concerning each instance of noncompliance described in the notice. Purchaser shall then have thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice (""Initial Cure Period"") to correct such noncompliance or submit to Seller a written plan to correct such noncompliance, which written plan is reasonably acceptable to Seller, unless Seller previously affirmatively concurs in writing, in its sole discretion, that Purchaser or its Subsidiaries is not in noncompliance.
 
7.2 SECOND CURE PERIOD. If the said noncompliance with the Quality Standards continues beyond the Initial Cure Period, Purchaser and Seller shall each promptly appoint a representative to negotiate in good faith actions that may be necessary to correct such noncompliance. The parties shall have fifteen (15) days following the expiration of the Initial Cure Period to agree on corrective actions, and Purchaser shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of an agreement of corrective actions to implement such corrective actions and cure or cause the cure of such noncompliance (""Second Cure Period"").
 
7.3 FINAL CURE PERIOD. If the said noncompliance with the Quality Standards by Purchaser or any Subsidiary (as the case may be) remains uncured after the expiration of the Second Cure Period, then at Seller's election, Purchaser or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) promptly shall cease offering the non-complying Licensed Products under the Licensed Marks until Seller reasonably determines that Purchaser, or the non-complying Subsidiary (as the case may be) has reasonably demonstrated its ability and
 
commitment to comply with the Quality Standards. Nothing in this Article VII shall be deemed to limit Purchaser's obligations under Section 3.3 above.
 
 
8.1 OWNERSHIP AND RIGHTS. Purchaser agrees not to challenge the ownership or validity of the Licensed Marks. Purchaser shall not disparage, dilute or adversely affect the validity of the Licensed Marks. Purchaser's use of the Licensed Marks shall inure exclusively to the benefit of Seller and Purchaser shall not acquire or assert any rights therein. Purchaser recognizes the value of the goodwill associated with the Licensed Marks, and that the Licensed Marks may have acquired secondary meaning in the minds of the public.
 
8.2 PROTECTION OF MARKS. Purchaser shall assist Seller, at Seller's request and expense, in the procurement and maintenance of Seller's respective intellectual property rights in the Licensed Marks. Purchaser will not grant or attempt to grant a security interest in the Licensed Marks or record any such security interest in the United States Patent and Trademark Office or elsewhere against any Trademark application or registration belonging to Seller. Purchaser agrees to, and to cause its Subsidiaries to, execute all documents reasonably requested by Seller to effect further registration of, maintenance and renewal of the Licensed Marks, recordation of the license relationship between Seller and Purchaser, and recordation of Purchaser as a registered user. Seller makes no warranty or representation that Trademark registrations have been or will be applied for, secured or maintained in the Licensed Marks throughout, or anywhere within, the world. Purchaser shall cause to appear on all Licensed Products, all Marketing Materials and all Collateral Materials, such legends, markings and notices as may be required by applicable law or reasonably requested by Seller.
 
8.3 SIMILAR MARKS. Purchaser agrees not to use or register in any country any Trademark that infringes on the rights of Seller in the Licensed Marks, or any element thereof. If any application for registration is, or has been, filed in any country by Purchaser which relates to any Trademark that infringes the rights of Seller in the Licensed Marks, Purchaser shall immediately abandon any such application or registration or assign it to Seller. Purchaser may not adopt any trademarks incorporating the root ""Agil"" or any other trademark similar to the Licensed Trademarks. Purchaser shall not challenge Seller's ownership of or the validity of the Licensed Marks or any application for registration thereof throughout the world. Purchaser shall not use or register in any country or jurisdiction, or permit others to use or register on its behalf in any country or jurisdiction, any copyright, domain name, telephone number, keyword, metatag, other electronic identifier or any other intellectual property right, whether recognized currently or in the future, or any other designation which would affect the ownership or rights of Seller in and to the Licensed Marks, or otherwise take any action which would adversely affect any of such ownership rights, or assist anyone else in doing so. Purchaser shall cause its Subsidiaries and Authorized Dealers to comply with the provisions of this Section 8.3.
 
8.4 INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS. In the event that the Purchaser learns, during the Term of this License, of any infringement or threatened infringement of the Licensed Marks, or any unfair competition, passing-off or dilution with respect to the Licensed
 
Marks, Purchaser shall immediately notify Seller or its authorized representative giving particulars thereof, and Purchaser shall provide necessary information and assistance to Seller or its authorized representatives at Seller's expense in the event that Seller decides that proceedings should be commenced. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser is not obligated to monitor or police use of the Licensed Marks by Third Parties other than as specifically set forth in Section 3.3 hereof. Except for those actions initiated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof to enforce any sublicense or other agreement with any Subsidiary or Authorized Dealer, Seller shall have exclusive control of any litigation, opposition, cancellation or related legal proceedings. The decision whether to bring, maintain or settle any such proceedings shall be at the exclusive option and expense of Seller, and all recoveries shall belong exclusively to Seller. Purchaser shall not and shall have no right to initiate any litigation, opposition, cancellation or related legal proceedings with respect to the Licensed Marks in its own name (except for those actions initiated by Purchaser pursuant to Section 3.3 hereof), but, at Seller's request, agrees to cooperate with Seller at Seller's expense to enforce its rights in the Licensed Marks, including to join or be joined as a party in any action taken by Seller against a third party for infringement or threatened infringement of the Licensed Marks, to the extent such joinder is required under mandatory local law for the prosecution of such an action. Seller shall incur no liability to Purchaser or any other Person under any legal theory by reason of Seller's failure or refusal to prosecute or by Seller's refusal to permit Purchaser to prosecute, any alleged infringement by Third Parties, nor by reason of any settlement to which Seller may agree.
 
 
9.1 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. The parties hereto expressly acknowledge and agree that all information, whether written or oral, furnished by either party to the other party or any Subsidiary of such other party pursuant to this License (""Confidential Information"") shall be deemed to be confidential and shall be maintained by each party and their respective Subsidiaries in confidence, using the same degree of care to preserve the confidentiality of such Confidential Information that the party to whom such Confidential Information is disclosed would use to preserve the confidentiality of its own information of a similar nature and in no event less than a reasonable degree of care. Except as authorized in writing by the other party, neither party shall at any time disclose or permit to be disclosed any such Confidential Information to any person, firm, corporation or entity: (a) except as may reasonably be required in connection with the performance of this License by Purchaser, Seller or its respective Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and (b) except as may reasonably be required after the Closing Date by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in connection with the use of the Licensed Marks or operation of the Business, and (c) except to the parties' agents or representatives who are informed by the parties of the confidential nature of the information and are bound to maintain its confidentiality, and (d) in the course of due diligence in connection with the sale of all or a portion of either party's business provided the disclosure is pursuant to a nondisclosure agreement having terms comparable to Sections 9.1 and 9.2 hereof.
 
9.2 EXCEPTIONS. The obligation not to disclose information under Section 9.1 hereof shall not apply to information that, as of the Closing Date or thereafter: (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of disclosure made after the execution of the APA by the party desiring to treat such information as non-confidential or any
 
of its Subsidiaries or representatives thereof, (b) was or becomes readily available to the party desiring to treat such information as non-confidential or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives thereof on a non-confidential basis, (c) is or becomes available to the party desiring to treat such information as non-confidential or any of its Subsidiaries or representatives thereof on a non-confidential basis from a source other than its own files or personnel or the other party or its Subsidiaries, provided that such source is not known by the party desiring to treat such information as non-confidential to be bound by confidentiality agreements with the other party or its Subsidiaries or by legal, fiduciary or ethical constraints on disclosure of such information, or (d) is required to be disclosed pursuant to a governmental order or decree or other legal requirement (including the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the listing rules of any applicable securities exchange), provided that the party required to disclose such information shall give the other party prompt notice thereof prior to such disclosure and, at the request of the other party, shall cooperate in all reasonable respects in maintaining the confidentiality of such information, including obtaining a protective order or other similar order. Nothing in Section 9.1 shall limit in any respect either party's ability to disclose information in connection with the enforcement by such party of its rights under this License; provided that the proviso of clause (d) in the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to the party desiring to disclose such information.
 
9.3 DURATION. The obligations of the parties set forth in this Article IX, with respect to the protection of Confidential Information, shall remain in effect until five years after: (a) the Closing Date, with respect to Confidential Information of one party that is known to or in the possession of the other party as of the Closing Date, or (ii) the date of disclosure, with respect to Confidential Information that is disclosed by the one party to the other party after the Closing Date.
 
 
10.1 The term of the license granted pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof shall begin on the Closing Date and, unless terminated sooner pursuant to the provisions of Article XII hereof, shall last for the periods set forth in Section 10.5 below.
 
10.2 ""Term"" as used herein means the foregoing periods of permissible use for the Licensed Marks.
 
10.3 ""Non-Customer-Facing Parts"" means tangible parts whose branding is not visible to end consumers in the ordinary course of use. For the avoidance of doubt, ""ordinary course of business"" includes normal inspection, use, calibration, maintenance, service, repair and/or failure analysis.
 
10.4 ""Seller Branded Products"" means Licensed Products on or in connection with which the Licensed Marks are used, unless such use is solely on Non-Customer-Facing Parts. Trademarks are in use ""on or in connection with"" a given Licensed Product if they are used on the Licensed Product itself or on Collateral Materials associated with such Licensed Product.
 
10.5 Purchaser agrees to discontinue all use of the Licensed Marks as quickly as is commercially reasonable. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right to use said Trademarks according to the following conditions and schedule, with which Purchaser shall comply strictly:
 
(a) For the thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser may use the Licensed Marks in connection with Corporate Identity Materials used for external communication which are maintained in digital format and/or as published on any website maintained by the Purchaser in connection with the conduct of the Business, on a royalty free basis;
 
(b) For the three (3) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser may use up any tangible stock of Corporate Identity Materials such as business cards, letterhead, stationery, paper stock and other supplies, in connection with the conduct of the Business on a royalty free basis, but only with respect to such items that, as of the Closing Date, are in hand or on order, and in all cases subject to Purchaser's compliance with Section 2.3(e) above;
 
(c) For the six (6) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser may use the Licensed Marks in any external signage on a royalty free basis, provided such signage was in use as of the Closing Date;
 
(d) As of the dates set forth in Section 10.5(a)-(c), Purchaser must cease all use of the Licensed Marks in connection with Corporate Identity Materials;
 
(e) For the six (6) months following the Closing DatePurchaser may use the Licensed Marks in Marketing Materials on a royalty free basis;
,
 
(f) As of six (6) months from the Closing Date, Purchaser must cease all use of Licensed Marks in Marketing Materials;
 
(g) For the twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser may use the Licensed Marks on a royalty free basis on or in connection with the Seller Branded Products manufactured by Seller prior to the Closing Date or manufactured by Purchaser within the eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date;
 
(h) As of thirty-six (36) months following the Closing Date, Purchaser must cease all use of Licensed Marks on or in connection with all Seller Branded Products. Except as would be a violation of law, any Non-Customer-Facing Parts bearing the Licensed Marks manufactured more than thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date shall bear a prominent label indicating that they are manufactured by Purchaser and, unless commercially unreasonable, such label shall cover the Licensed Marks on such part.
 
(i) Notwithstanding Section 10.5(f)-(h), Purchaser may continue to use the Seller part number alphanumerics beginning with the letter ""A"" (""Seller Part Numbers"") on or in connection with any Licensed Product or Semiconductor Products within the same Family as a Licensed Product until that Family is discontinued or obsoleted. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that this License does not purport to restrict Purchaser's use of any part number that does not begin with the letter ""A"".
 
10.6 Purchaser agrees to provide written confirmation of compliance with the License Term at thirty (30) days, three (3) months, six (6), eighteen (18), and thirty-six (36) months. Purchaser shall also advise Seller when it has discontinued use of all remaining Non-Customer-Facing Parts bearing the Licensed Marks and discontinued or obsoleted all Families of Licensed Products.
 
10.7 Except as would be a violation of Law, Purchaser agrees to notify all consumers receiving parts and materials bearing the Licensed Marks that Purchaser is the source of and is the proper contact for such Licensed Products, Collateral Materials, parts and materials.
 
10.8 It is understood and agreed that it shall not be a violation of this License for Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or Authorized Dealers, at any time after the Term, to make accurate references to the fact that Purchaser has succeeded to the business of Seller with respect to the Licensed Products, or to advertise or promote its or their provision of maintenance services or supply of spare parts for Licensed Products previously sold under any of the Licensed Marks, provided that Purchaser, its Subsidiaries and Authorized Dealers do not in connection therewith suggest any affiliation with Seller, do not claim to be authorized by Seller in any manner with respect to such activities, and do not brand any Semiconductor Products, Marketing Materials, Collateral Materials or parts Sold after the Term with any of the Licensed Marks in a manner that is inconsistent with this ARTICLE X.
 
 
11.1 ROYALTIES.
 
(a) Upon any Sale occurring: (i) less than thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of Seller Branded Products manufactured by Purchaser more than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, or (ii) more than twenty-four months and less than thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries of Seller Branded Products (other than repaired, refurbished or reconstructed Seller Branded Products or repair parts) manufactured by Seller prior to the Closing Date or by Purchaser less than eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date Purchaser shall pay to Seller a         % royalty on the Net Sales earned by Purchaser in each Seller fiscal quarter as a result of such Sale.
,
 
(b) As used in this Article XI, ""Net Sales"" means the gross invoice price from: (i) royalty-bearing Sales under Section 11.1(a) above, in any case less: (1) charges for handling, freight, sales taxes, insurance costs and import duties where such items are included in the invoiced price, (2) point-of-sale credits (or other similar adjustments to price) granted to independent distributors, and (3) credits actually granted or refunds actually given for returns during such Seller fiscal quarter. In the event that the foregoing Seller Branded Products are Sold for no or nominal consideration or to a SubsidiaryAuthorized Dealer, affiliated company or in any other circumstances in which the selling price is established on other than an arms-length basis, the Net Sales on such Sales shall be determined on the average selling price earned
,
 
by Seller during the preceding Seller fiscal quarter on Sales of like volumes of the applicable Seller Branded Products to unaffiliated customers in arms-length sales. However, in the event that the foregoing Seller Branded Products are Sold to Seller's Subsidiaries, Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies for resale to Third Parties, then the royalties will be based on Net Sales from the Subsidiaries Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies to the Third Parties and no royalties will be due on the Sales to the Subsidiaries, Authorized Dealers or affiliated companies.
,
 
(c) For the purposes of clarification, no royalty is due under this Article XI for uses of the Licensed Marks that are covered by Section 10.8. Also, no royalties will accrue at any time for the use of Seller Part Numbers.
 
11.2 PAYMENTS AND ACCOUNTING.
 
(a) With respect to the royalties set forth herein, Seller shall keep full, clear and accurate records until otherwise provided in Section 11.2(b). These records shall be retained for a period of three (3) years from the date of payment notwithstanding the expiration or other termination of this License. Purchaser shall have the right, through a mutually agreed upon independent certified public accountant (consent to which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed by Purchaser), and at Seller's expense, to examine and audit, not more than once a year, and during normal business hours, all such records and such other records and accounts as may under recognized accounting practices contain information bearing upon the amount of royalty payable to Seller under this License. Prompt adjustment shall be made by either party to compensate for any errors and/or omissions disclosed by such examination or audit. Should any such error and/or omission result in an underpayment of more than five percent (5%) of the total royalties due for the period under audit, Purchaser shall, upon Seller's request, pay for the cost of the audit and pay Seller an additional fee equal to a compound annual interest rate of ten percent (10%) of such error and/or omission.
 
(b) Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each Purchaser fiscal quarter, Purchaser shall furnish to Seller a statement in suitable form showing all Seller Branded Products subject to royalties that were sold, during such quarter, and the amount of royalty payable thereon. If no Licensed Products or services subject to royalty have been sold, that fact shall be shown on such statement. Also, within such forty-five (45) days, Purchaser shall pay to Seller the royalties payable hereunder for such quarter. Purchaser and Seller will determine the form of the statement prior to submission of the first such statement. All royalty and other payments to Seller hereunder shall be in United States dollars. Royalties based on sales in other currencies shall be converted to United States dollars according to the official rate of exchange for that currency, as published in the Wall Street Journal on the last day of the calendar month in which the royalty accrued (or, if not published on that day, the last publication day for the Wall Street Journal during that month). If two consecutive Purchaser fiscal quarters pass in which no royalties are due under this License and Purchaser reasonably believes no royalties will be due, the obligations pursuant to this Article XI shall terminate. If Purchaser resumes sale of Seller Branded Products that are subject to royalties, the obligations of this Article XI shall automatically resume.
 
 
12.1 VOLUNTARY TERMINATION. By written notice to Seller, Purchaser may voluntarily terminate all or a specified portion of the licenses and rights granted to it hereunder by Seller. Such notice shall specify the effective date of such termination and shall clearly specify any affected Licensed Marks and Licensed Products.
 
12.2 SURVIVAL. Any voluntary termination of licenses and rights of Purchaser under Section 12.1 hereof shall not affect Purchaser's licenses and rights with respect to any Licensed Products made or furnished prior to such termination.
 
 
13.1 NEGOTIATION. The parties shall make a good faith attempt to resolve any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this License through negotiation. Within thirty (30) days after notice of a dispute or claim is given by either party to the other party, the parties' first tier negotiating teams (as determined by each party's Director of Intellectual Property (or person holding a similar position or title) or his or her delegate) shall meet and make a good faith attempt to resolve such dispute or claim and shall continue to negotiate in good faith in an effort to resolve the dispute or claim or renegotiate the applicable section or provision without the necessity of any formal proceedings. If the first tier negotiating teams are unable to agree within thirty (30) days of their first meeting, then the parties' second tier negotiating teams (as determined by each party's Director of Intellectual Property or his or her delegate) shall meet within thirty (30) days after the end of the first thirty (30) day negotiating period to attempt to resolve the matter. During the course of negotiations under this Section 13.1, all reasonable requests made by one party to the other for information, including requests for copies of relevant documents will be honored. The specific format for such negotiations will be left to the discretion of the designated negotiating teams but may include the preparation of agreed upon statements of fact or written statements of position furnished to the other party. All negotiations between the parties pursuant to this Section 13.1 shall be treated as compromise and settlement negotiations. Nothing said or disclosed, nor any document produced, in the course of such negotiations that is not otherwise independently discoverable shall be offered or received as evidence or used for impeachment or for any other purpose in any current or future litigation.
 
13.2 NONBINDING MEDIATION. In the event that any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this License is not settled by the parties within fifteen (15) days after the first meeting of the second tier negotiating teams under Section 13.1 hereof, the parties will attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute or claim by nonbinding mediation in accordance with the American Arbitration Association Commercial Mediation Rules. The mediation shall be held within thirty (30) days of the end of such fifteen (15) day negotiation period of the second tier negotiating teams. Except as provided below in Section 13.3, no litigation for the resolution of such dispute may be commenced until the parties try in good faith to settle the dispute by such mediation in accordance with such rules, and either party has concluded in good faith that amicable resolution through continued mediation of the matter does not appear likely. The costs of mediation shall be shared equally by the parties to the mediation. Any settlement
 
reached by mediation shall be recorded in writing, signed by the parties, and shall be binding on them.
 
13.3 PROCEEDINGS. Nothing herein, however, shall prohibit either party from initiating litigation or other judicial or administrative proceedings if such party would be substantially harmed by a failure to act during the time that such good faith efforts are being made to resolve the dispute or claim through negotiation or mediation. In the event that litigation is commenced under this Section 13.3, the parties agree to continue to attempt to resolve any dispute or claim according to the terms of Sections 13.1 and 13.2 hereof during the course of such litigation proceedings under this Section 13.3.
 
 
IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR ANY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 
 
15.1 DISCLAIMER. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE SET FORTH HEREIN OR IN THE APA, EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL LICENSED MARKS AND ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR MATERIALS LICENSED OR FURNISHED HEREUNDER ARE LICENSED OR FURNISHED WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, WITH RESPECT THERETO INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF TITLE, ENFORCEABILITY OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.

Neither party is required hereunder to furnish or disclose to the other any information (including copies of registrations of the Trademarks), except as specifically provided herein or in the APA.
 
15.3 INFRINGEMENT SUITS. Neither party shall have any obligation hereunder to institute any action or suit against Third Parties for infringement of any of the Licensed Marks or to defend any action or suit brought by a Third Party which challenges or
 
concerns the validity of any of the Licensed Marks. Purchaser shall not have any right to institute any action or suit against Third Parties for infringement of any of the Licensed Marks.
 
15.4 NO OBLIGATION TO OBTAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKS. Neither party, nor any of its Subsidiaries, is obligated to: (a) file any application for registration of any Trademark, or to secure any rights in any Trademarks, (b) maintain any Trademark registration, or (c) provide any assistance, except for the obligations expressly assumed in this License.
 
15.5 ENTIRE AGREEMENT. This License and the APA constitute the entire understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and shall supersede all prior written and oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements and understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof.

It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 14, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.50 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, 2005, 26 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.41 billion, five percent above last year. Fourth quarter GAAP net earnings were $26 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with $74 million, or $0.15 per share, in last year's fourth quarter.
 
During the fourth quarter, Agilent announced a definitive agreement to sell its Semiconductor Products business. As such, the business is being treated as a Discontinued Operation in its fourth quarter GAAP financial statements. If Semiconductor Products had been a continuing operation, Agilent would have reported fourth quarter orders of $1.98 billion, 24 percent above last year, and total revenues of $1.90 billion
(1)
, four percent above one year ago.
 
Included in fourth quarter GAAP net earnings is a $48 million tax charge associated with repatriating $970 million of off-shore earnings under the Homeland Investment Act. Also included in GAAP results is $119 million composed largely of restructuring costs associated with Agilent's announced sale of its Semiconductor Products business and with the planned spin-off of the company's Semiconductor Test Solutions (STS) business. Excluding those costs, Agilent reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $193 million, or $0.38 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $153 million, or $0.30 per share, one year ago
(2)
.
 
""Agilent had a strong finish to a remarkable year,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Including Semiconductor Products, fourth quarter total revenues were slightly above the top end of our expectations, as most of our markets gained momentum during the quarter. The quality of our performance was also good, with adjusted net income at the top of our guidance range.
 
""In both the Electronic Measurement and Bio-Analytical Measurement segments, we believe Agilent gained market share. In addition, both segments for the first time exceeded our long-term operating model target of 14 percent operating margins and 21 percent Return on Invested Capital
(3)
. With our businesses performing well and the planned dispositions of Semiconductor Products, Lumileds and STS all on track, we are excited about the opportunities to create superior value for our owners and customers in fiscal 2006.""
 
In the fourth quarter, the company generated $410 million in cash from operating activities and, after $51 million of capital spending, $359 million in operating free cash flow.
(4)
Both inventory days-on-hand and receivables days sales outstanding were at new record lows. During the quarter, the company repurchased about 8.9 million common shares for $290 million.
Separately, the Agilent board has authorized a share repurchase of up to approximately $2.7 billion in the form of a modified ""Dutch Auction"" tender offer to purchase up to 73 million shares of its common stock at a price per share not less than $32 and not greater than $37. The tender offer is expected to commence on Nov. 15, 2005, and to expire, unless extended, on Dec. 13, 2005. As of Oct. 31, 2005, Agilent had approximately 500 million shares of common stock outstanding.
 
Looking ahead, Agilent expects to receive proceeds from the sale of its 47 percent share of Lumileds within the month, and to complete the sale of its Semiconductor Products business on December 1. Preparations for a planned spin-off of its Semiconductor Test Solutions business continue on schedule with an expected IPO to take place near mid-FY2006.
 
The company remains comfortable with the fiscal year 2006 guidance it provided during its August 15 announcements. For the first quarter of fiscal 2006, the company expects revenues (including STS) in the range of $1.28 billion to $1.35 billion, up 5 to 10 percent from last year and consistent with its normal seasonality. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.25 to $0.30 per share
(5)
, roughly double last year's first quarter comparable earnings.
 
Segment Results
(6)
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Momentum in Bio-Analytical Measurement improved during the fourth quarter. Record orders of $402 million were 10 percent above last year, with Life Sciences up 11 percent and Chemical Analysis orders up 9 percent compared with last year. Demand from large pharmaceutical customers remains mixed but the segment saw strength in both biotech firms and generic pharmaceutical companies. Demand for the new gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC/MS) platform drove growth within Chemical Analysis. Revenue of $382 million was up 9 percent versus last year, slightly off our expectations of double digit growth but still sharply higher than earlier in the year.
 
Segment income from operations of $65 million was $8 million above last year, with an operating margin of 17 percent compared to last year's 16 percent. Higher profits and excellent capital management enabled the segment to achieve a Return On Invested Capital
(3)
(ROIC) of 36 percent during the quarter, 12 points better than last year.
 
Electronic Measurement
(6)
($ millions except where noted)
 
This segment now includes about $80 million in orders from the Parametric Test and Electronic Manufacturing Test business units that were previously included in the Automated Test segment. Electronic Measurement regained momentum during the fourth quarter, with orders of $903 million up 18 percent from one year ago. Overall segment demand was strong, with the highest level of orders since mid-2001. Both wireless and wireline test markets were up double-digit percentages from last year, and general purpose test was up 6 percent from one year ago. Revenues of $866 million were slightly below last year and up 11 percent from the prior three months.
 
Fourth quarter income from operations of $131 million was $3 million above last year's strong performance on $4 million lower revenues. During the quarter, Electronic Measurement achieved a 25 percent ROIC
(3)
, up 8 points from last year due to a lower average tax rate and improved capital management.
 
Semiconductor Test Solutions
(6)
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
This segment is now composed exclusively of the System-On-Chip (SOC) Test and the Memory Test businesses. As announced previously, the company intends to spin-off STS as soon as practical in 2006, with an expected IPO date near mid-FY2006.
 
The solid rebound in Semiconductor Test orders continued in the fourth quarter, with orders of $199 million up more than 200 percent from last year's fourth quarter trough. Revenues of $159 million were 39 percent above last year and up 36 percent sequentially. Segment book-to-bill of 1.25 is more than double last year's 0.56 and equal to the third quarter.
 
The $2 million fourth quarter loss from operations compares to a loss of $18 million in the prior year and prior quarter. The loss in the current quarter was primarily due to a $10 million write-off of Flash memory test inventory because of the discontinuance of certain products.

In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix, and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended Oct. 31, 2004, and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended July 31, 2005. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
 
 
 
 
The preliminary statement of operations is estimated based on our current information. The final closings of the sale of our semiconductor products business and our stake in Lumileds Lighting International, B.V. are still pending and may impact the final financial statements as of October 31, 2005 and 2004.

Reconciliation of Total Revenue to Revenue from Continuing Operations (in millions)
 
 
Total revenue is a non-GAAP measure which management believes provides useful information to management and investors. We believe it is useful for management and investors to see the company the way it has been in the past as well as the way it will look in the future. Total revenues show the company on a basis that is comparable to prior periods. It is useful for measuring our results compared to past expectations. We also provide revenue from continuing operations which is a measure of future Agilent revenues without the Semiconductor Products business.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
 
 
 
Earnings per share was computed using the diluted weighted average shares. In order to calculate non-GAAP diluted net income per share for fiscal year 2004, we added 36 million shares and approximately $7 million of after-tax interest expense to non-GAAP net income to treat the then outstanding senior convertible debenture as if they were converted.
 
We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments, from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure which management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria. We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitatility in relation to net asset investments. We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company. We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
 
Reconciliation of Operating Free Cash Flow
(in millions)
Q4'05
 
 
Operating free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure which management believes provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business after the acquisition of property and equipment, which can then be used for strategic opportunities including investing in the Company's business and making strategic acquisitions. Our management uses this measure which is a common one in our industry to compare ourselves to our competitors and to measure our own performance. A limitation of operating free cash flow is that it does not represent the total increase or decrease in the cash balance for the period. Our management compensates for this limitation by monitoring and providing the reader with a complete GAAP statement of cash flows which includes net cash provided by operating activities.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Exhibit 99.2
 
 
Agilent Technologies Announces Intent to Repurchase up to $2.7 Billion of Its Common Stock through a Modified ""Dutch Auction"" Tender Offer
 
PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 14, 2005  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today announced that it will commence a modified ""Dutch Auction"" tender offer to purchase up to 73 million shares of its common stock at a price per share not less than $32.00 and not greater than $37.00. The tender offer is expected to begin on Nov. 15, 2005, and to expire on Dec. 13, 2005, unless extended. The number of shares proposed to be purchased in the tender offer represents approximately 14.2 percent of Agilent's currently outstanding shares. Tenders of shares must be made prior to the expiration of the tender offer and may be withdrawn at any time prior to that time.
 
On the terms and subject to the conditions of the tender offer, Agilent's stockholders will have the opportunity to tender some or all of their shares at a price within the $32.00 to $37.00 per share range. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering stockholders, Agilent will determine the lowest per-share price within the range that will enable it to buy 73 million shares, or such lesser number of shares that are tendered and not withdrawn. All shares accepted in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price per share even if the stockholder tendered at a lower price. If stockholders tender more than 73 million shares at or below the purchase price per share, Agilent will purchase the shares tendered at or below the determined purchase price by those stockholders, subject to proration and certain other factors.
 
The tender offer is not contingent upon any minimum number of shares being tendered. The tender offer is, however, subject to a number of other terms and conditions, including receiving the proceeds of the sale of Agilent's Semiconductor Products Group (""SPG""), currently expected to occur on or about Dec. 1, 2005, the sale of Agilent's stake in Lumileds Lighting International B.V. (""Lumileds"") to Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V., currently expected to close by the end of November 2005, as well as a bridge financing of $1.0 billion. It is expected that the bridge financing will be replaced by longer-term financing in an amount of up to $1.5 billion shortly after the close of the offer.
 
Agilent's board of directors has approved the tender offer because it has concluded that, given Agilent's business profile following the pending sales of SPG and its stake in Lumileds, and the company's currently intended spin-off of its System-on-Chip (SOC) and Memory Test businesses, its remaining assets and the recent market prices for Agilent's common stock, the offer is a prudent use of Agilent's financial resources. The tender offer is part of Agilent's previously announced share repurchase program of up to $4.466 billion worth of its common stock. None of Agilent, its board of directors, the dealer manager, the depositary, or the information agent is making any recommendations to stockholders as to whether to tender or refrain from tendering their shares into the tender offer. Stockholders must decide how many shares they will tender, if any, and the price within the stated range at which they will offer their shares for purchase by Agilent.
 
Agilent's directors and executive officers have advised Agilent that they do not intend to tender any of their shares in the tender offer.
 
Merrill Lynch & Co. is the company's financial advisor and dealer manager for the tender offer. The information agent is Georgeson Shareholder Communications Inc., and the depositary is Computershare. The Offer to Purchase, a letter of transmittal and related documents shortly will be mailed to stockholders of record and also will be made available for distribution to beneficial owners of Agilent's common stock. For questions and information, please call the information agent toll-free at (888) 293-6903.

(NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.35 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2006, 15 percent above one year ago.  Revenues during the quarter were $1.34 billion, 10 percent above last year.  First quarter GAAP net earnings were $2.82 billion, or $5.83 per diluted share, compared with $103 million, or $0.21 per share, in last year's first quarter.
PALO ALTO, Calif., Feb. 13, 2006 Agilent Technologies Inc.
 
During the first quarter, Agilent sold its Semiconductor Products business for $2.7 billion and its 47 percent share of Lumileds for approximately $1.0 billion.  The pre-tax gain on the sale of these businesses was approximately $2.7 billion.  Also included in GAAP results are $63 million of charges related to the planned spin-off of Semiconductor Test Solutions (STS) and the reduction of Agilent's infrastructure costs.  Excluding these charges and $36 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, Agilent reported first quarter adjusted net income of $154 million, or $0.32 per share.  On a comparable basis, the company earned $71 million, or $0.15 per share, one year ago. (1)
 
""We are pleased with Agilent's performance in the first quarter of 2006,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer.  ""We successfully completed the semiconductor-related divestitures and a self -tender offer that returned $3 billion of cash to our owners.  Operationally, we also performed to our commitments, with revenues and adjusted net income at the high end of our expectations after reflecting fewer shares outstanding during the quarter.""
 
Sullivan noted that gross margins were at the highest level in five years, that working capital ratios were at a first quarter record low, and that the company achieved its targeted 21 percent Return on Invested Capital(2) during the quarter.  ""With backlog at its highest level in 1  years and a continued rapid pace of new product introductions, we are well positioned for the second quarter and 2006.""
 
For the second quarter of fiscal 2006, the company expects revenues (including STS) in the range of $1.37 billion to $1.43 billion, up 6 to 12 percent from last year.  Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.35 to $0.40 per share(3), roughly double last year's comparable earnings. For the full year, the company remains comfortable with the range of analyst estimates for adjusted net income.  Preparations for a planned spin-off of STS continue on schedule, with an initial public offering expected to take place near mid-year 2006.
 
Segment Results
(4)
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Momentum in Bio-Analytical Measurement was mixed during the first quarter of 2006.  Orders of $378 million were 6 percent above last year and up 11 percent in local currency terms.  Life Sciences orders were up 9
percent, with modest growth from traditional pharmaceutical customers, sustained strength from generic pharmaceutical companies, and accelerating demand for proteomics and genomics products from biotech firms.  Chemical Analysis orders rose 4 percent, with an 8 percent increase in platform sales partially offset by delayed service agreement renewals during the quarter.  Revenues of $373 million were up 5 percent from last year.
 
Segment income from operations of $52 million was $1 million above last year.  A one-point improvement in gross margins was more than offset by a $12 million increase in operating expenses to fund recent acquisitions, for planned new product introductions and for incremental investments in molecular diagnostics.  The first quarter's 14 percent operating margin was equal to last year, while segment Return On Invested Capital (2)fell one point to a still attractive 28 percent.
 
On Feb. 1, 2006, Agilent completed the purchase of Yokogawa Electric Company's 49 percent ownership of Yokogawa Analytical Systems (YAN) for $98 million.
 
Electronic Measurement
(4)
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Electronic Measurement continued to show good momentum in the first quarter, with orders of $799 million up 8 percent from last year; excluding the impact of a higher dollar, local currency orders were up 11 percent from one year ago.  Communications test orders were up 6 percent, with strength in wireless offset by flat wireline test orders.  General purpose test orders were up 12 percent from one year ago, with strength in Aerospace / Defense and across the oscilloscope product line.  Revenues of $794 million were up only 2 percent from last year due in part to the early Chinese New Year, which impacted deliveries to Asian customers, and to the lumpiness of Operations Support Systems revenues.  Backlog has increased 10 percent over the past year.
First quarter income from operations of $89 million was up $21 million on a $14 million increase in revenue.  Gross margin improved 4 points to 55 percent, and segment operating margin rose 2  points to 11 percent. ROIC (2) improved 7 points to 18 percent based on better operating margins and reductions in working capital.
 
Semiconductor Test Solutions
(4)
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
The rebound in Semiconductor Test Solutions continued to gain momentum in the first quarter, with orders of $176 million up 115 percent from last year.  SOC orders were up 114 percent from last year, with the new PinScale platform representing over 80 percent of new orders.  Memory test orders were up 98 percent, with virtually all orders for the new V5000 series platform.  Revenues of $169 million were 117 percent above one year ago.  Segment book-to-bill of 1.04 compares with an industry average of 0.95.
 
Segment income of $16 million compares with a $40 million loss one year ago.  Gross margins doubled from last year to 44 percent and included an $8 million charge for the discontinuance of certain products, while operating expenses were flat over the period.  Operating margin improved to 9 percent.  Return On Invested Capital(2) during the quarter reached 17 percent.

Adjusted net income is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes annualized divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 5 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(3)Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q206 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock based compensation and intangible amortization.  Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided.  Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $5 million per quarter.
 
(4) Historical segment data have been restated to correspond to current presentation.

Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Income from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2006 included pre-tax share-based compensation expense under SFAS 123(R) of $36 million related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases.
 
The preliminary income statement is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
The preliminary balance sheet is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
The preliminary cash flow statement is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end  balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(b)
Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Historical amounts were reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring  segment profitatility in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.

Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the company's earnings and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the company. The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

PALO ALTO, Calif., May 15, 2006  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.59 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2006, 21 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.43 billion, 12 percent above last year. Second quarter GAAP income from continuing operations was $131 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with $53 million, or $0.11 per share, in last year's second quarter.
 
Included in GAAP results are $22 million of net charges related principally to the planned spinoff of Semiconductor Test Solutions (STS) and the reduction of Agilent's infrastructure costs. Excluding these charges and $25 million of non-cash stock compensation expenses, Agilent reported second quarter adjusted net income of $178 million, or $0.40 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $84 million, or $0.17 per share, one year ago.(1)
""Agilent continued to deliver on its operating and strategic commitments during the second quarter of 2006,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Both revenues and adjusted earnings per share were at the high end of our expectations. Preparations for a spinoff of STS are on schedule. As of mid-year, we have successfully reduced Agilent's global infrastructure to a level commensurate with a pure-play measurement company. Despite the separation and restructuring costs associated with these actions, Agilent generated approximately $300 million in cash from operating activities during the second quarter.""
 
(2)during the quarter. ""At this point,"" he said, ""the fundamental strategic opportunity for this company is to leverage the robust operating model we've built through higher sustainable growth.""
Sullivan noted that gross margins remained at the highest level in five years, that inventories were below 100 Days On Hand for the first time, and that the company achieved a 24 percent Return on Invested Capital
 
 
Looking ahead, Agilent (including STS) expects third quarter fiscal 2006 revenues of $1.37 billion to $1.43 billion, up 10 to 15 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.37 to $0.42 per share(3), roughly double last year's comparable earnings. Normal seasonality would suggest fourth quarter revenues roughly 5 percent above the third quarter and an increase in operating earnings of about $0.10 per share.
 
Note: The segment results listed below are for the Bio-Analytical Measurement and Electronic Measurement groups. Because of the planned spinoff of STS, Agilent is not reporting separate STS segment results at this time.
 
Segment Results

Exhibit 99.1
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 15, 2007  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders from continuing operations of $1.25 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2007, 6 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.28 billion, 10 percent above last year. First quarter GAAP income from continuing operations before equity income was $150 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, compared with $73 million, or $0.15 per share, in last year's first quarter.
Included in this quarter's GAAP income from continuing operations is $36 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $24 million of tax and other net gains, Agilent reported first quarter adjusted net income from continuing operations of $162 million, or $0.39 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $142 million, or $0.29 per share, one year ago. (1)

""Agilent performed well in this year's first quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""We met expectations for revenues and earnings growth, with notable strength across our Bio-Analytical Measurement portfolio, and despite significant weakness in wireless handset test."" In Q1, revenues were up 10 percent, and adjusted net income per share from continuing operations, at $0.39 per share, was 34 percent above last year's results.
Sullivan noted that the company's Bio-Analytical revenue was up 22 percent, outpacing all competitors and setting a record for revenue, profit and growth for this business segment: ""The success of our new product introductions is clearly evident in the first quarter performance of this segment."" Sullivan also noted that, while Electronic Measurement grew 4 percent, segment revenue growth excluding the impact of a weak handset test market was about 9 percent.
First quarter Return on Invested Capital(2) reached 23 percent, one point better than last year's strong performance, while receivables Days-Sales-Outstanding improved 3 days, and inventory Days-On-Hand improved 5 days. Cash generated from operating activities was $93 million in the seasonally weak first quarter. During the period, the company invested $70 million in acquisitions and repurchased $254 million of its common stock. The company ended the quarter with net cash of $2.1 billion.
Sullivan added, ""We expect the relative performance of our business segments to be repeated in the current quarter, and to see improved momentum in Electronic Measurement during the second half of the fiscal year. Overall, we remain comfortable with the range of analyst estimates for the second quarter and for fiscal year 2007.""
In the fiscal second quarter of 2007, Agilent expects revenues of $1.30 billion to $1.34 billion, up 5 percent to 8 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.41 to $0.45 per share(3), 14 percent to 25 percent above last year's comparable earnings.

During the quarter, the segment's book-to-bill ratio dropped below 1.00 for the first time in three years as it worked off $21 million of its record fourth quarter backlog. Life Sciences revenues of $195 million were up 23 percent, driven by year-end spending in pharmaceutical and biotech spending, and by the continued success of Agilent's new 1200 Series Liquid Chromatograph platform. Chemical Analysis revenues of $260 million were up 21 percent from last year, with particular strength in spending by petrochemical firms, and sustained momentum in Asia in the categories of food safety and the environment.

Adjusted net income from continuing operations and adjusted net income from continuing operations per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, donations to the Agilent Foundation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. Adjusted net income from continuing operations excludes the impact of

discontinued operations. A reconciliation between adjusted net income from continuing operations, adjusted net income, and GAAP net income from continuing operations is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2) Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 5 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(3) Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q207 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things,  the impact of the sale of our businesses and investments from the results of the sales of our products. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services).  These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as restructuring charges and sales of investments can have a material impact on our cash flows and net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.

Item 1.01.              Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
On May 11, 2007, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the ""Company"") entered into a Five Year Credit Agreement (the ""Credit Agreement"") by and among the Company, certain lenders party thereto (the ""Lenders""), and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administration agent.
The Credit Agreement provides for a $300 million unsecured credit facility (the ""Facility"") that will expire on May 11, 2012.  The Company will use amounts borrowed under the Facility for general corporate purposes.  The Company is not borrowing under the Facility at this time, but may borrow under the Facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise.
Loans under the Credit Agreement will bear interest either at: (i) the greater of (a) JPMorgan's prime rate in effect from time to time and (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect form time to time plus 0.5%, or (ii) the applicable London interbank offered rate plus the applicable margin for such loans, which ranges between 0.270% and 0.650%, based on the Company's senior debt credit ratings as published by Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and which is 0.425% at the Company's current credit ratings. The applicable London interbank offered rate, if utilized, will be increased by 0.10% for any period in which the aggregate principal amount of advances and letters of credit under the Facility is equal to or exceeds $150 million. The Company will pay an annual facility fee during the term of the Credit Agreement which varies depending on the Company's credit ratings. At the Company's current ratings, the facility fee will be 0.125% per year, or $375,000 per year.
The Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants. Negative covenants include, among others, limitations on incurrence of liens, and limitations on incurrence of indebtedness by the Company's subsidiaries.  In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that the Company maintain a ratio of adjusted consolidated debt to consolidated EBITDA of not greater than 3.25 to 1.00, and a ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated interest expense of not less than 3.00 to 1.00.
                The Credit Agreement contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an event of default, the Lenders may declare the outstanding advances and all other obligations under the Credit Agreement immediately due and payable.
J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. are acting as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners for the Facility.
The description of the Credit Agreement contained herein is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Credit Agreement, a copy of which is filed herewith as Exhibit 10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
Item 2.02.              Results of Operations and Financial Condition.
The information in this Item 2.02 of Form 8-K and Exhibit 99.1 attached hereto is furnished and shall not be deemed ""filed"" for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, nor shall it be deemed incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
On May 14, 2007, the Company issued its press release announcing financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2007.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.

We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Letters of Credit.
General
in the first sentence of this paragraph, the Company will be fully responsible for the reimbursement of LC Disbursements, the payment of interest thereon and the payment of fees due under Section 2.12(b) to the same extent as if it were the sole account party in respect of such Letter of Credit (the Company hereby irrevocably waiving any defenses that might otherwise be available to it as a guarantor of the obligations of any Subsidiary that shall be an account party in respect of any such Letter of Credit).
(b) .  To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the requesting Borrower shall deliver (or transmit by electronic communication, if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent, reasonably in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with paragraph (c) of this Section), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be reasonably necessary to enable the applicable Issuing Bank to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit.

A Letter of Credit may provide for automatic renewals for additional periods of up to one year subject to a right on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal from occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary during a specified period in advance of any such renewal, and the failure of such Issuing Bank to give such notice by the end of such period shall for all purposes hereof be deemed an extension of such Letter of Credit; that in no event shall any Letter of Credit, as extended from time to time, expire after the date that is five Business Days prior to the Maturity Date.

(e)   If an Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if such Borrower shall have received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by such Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on (i) the Business Day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is received prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day of receipt, or (ii) the Business Day immediately following the day that such Borrower receives such notice, if such notice is not received prior to such time on the day of receipt; that the applicable Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, such Borrower's obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan. If such Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the applicable Issuing Bank shall notify the Administrative Agent of such failure in accordance with Section 2.05(l), and the Administrative Agent shall in turn notify each Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the amount of the payment then due from such Borrower in respect thereof and such Lender's Applicable Percentage thereof.

None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, any Issuing Bank or any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of such Issuing Bank; that nothing in this Section shall be construed to excuse an Issuing Bank from liability to the applicable Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by each Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by such Issuing Bank's failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of an Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction), such Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, an Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to paragraph (e) of this Section to reimburse such Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.
Interim Interest.

(i) If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Company receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, each applicable Borrower shall deposit in respect of each outstanding Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower's account (or, in the case of the Company, with respect to which it is a co-applicant), in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders and the applicable Issuing Bank, an amount in cash equal to the portion of the LC Exposure attributable to such Letter of Credit as of such date plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon; that the obligation to cash collateralize shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Company or any Borrower described in clause (h) or (i) of Article VII.  Each such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement.  The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrowers' risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest.  Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account.  Monies in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Banks for LC Disbursements for which they have not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrowers for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Lenders with LC Exposures representing more than 50% of the aggregate amount of LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other

At the time any such termination shall become effective, the Company shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the terminated Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b).  From and after the effective date of any such termination, the terminated Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not issue additional Letters of Credit.
Termination of an Issuing Bank.
(l)   Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank shall report in writing to the Administrative Agent (i) on or prior to each Business Day on which such Issuing Bank issues, amends, renews or extends any Letter of Credit, the date of such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, and the face amounts of the Letters of Credit issued, amended, renewed or extended by it and outstanding after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (and whether the amounts thereof shall have changed), it being understood that such Issuing Bank shall not effect any issuance, renewal, extension or amendment resulting in an increase in the aggregate amount of the Letters of Credit issued by it without first obtaining written confirmation from the Administrative Agent that such increase is then permitted under this Agreement, (ii) on any Business Day on which such Issuing Bank makes any LC Disbursement, the date and amount of such LC Disbursement, (iii) on any Business Day on which the applicable Borrower fails to reimburse an LC Disbursement required to be reimbursed to such Issuing Bank on such day, the date of such failure and the amount of such LC Disbursement and (iv) on any other Business Day, such other information as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably request as to the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank.

The Administrative Agent will make such Revolving Loans available to the applicable Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to the account designated by such Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request; that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
Funding of Borrowings.
provided
(b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Revolving Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's share of such Revolving Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with paragraph (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the applicable Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Revolving Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and such Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to such Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the rate reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount or (ii) in the case of such Borrower, the interest rate applicable to the subject Revolving Loan pursuant to Section 2.13 (it being understood that nothing in this paragraph shall require any Borrower to pay any interest in duplication of the interest payable under such Section).
SECTION 2.07. (a) Each Revolving Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a LIBOR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.

A Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of an affected Revolving Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Revolving Borrowing and the Loans resulting from an election made with respect to any such portion shall be considered a separate Revolving Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Loans, which may not be converted or continued.
Interest Elections.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the electing Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if such Borrower were requesting a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made
on the effective date of such election. Each such Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or fax to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by a Financial Officer on behalf of the applicable Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, a Borrower shall not be permitted to elect an Interest Period for LIBOR Loans that does not comply with Section 2.02(d).
(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing;
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day;
(iii) the Type of the resulting Borrowing; and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is to be a LIBOR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term ""Interest Period"".
If any such Interest Election Request requests a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the applicable Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one month's duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender's portion of each resulting Revolving Borrowing.
(e) If the applicable Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a LIBOR Revolving Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period, such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing.
(f) Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrowers, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Revolving Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a LIBOR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each LIBOR Revolving Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Revolving Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.

Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Company pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable; that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Company may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Company (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments.
provided
(d) The Company may from time to time, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) executed by the Company and one or more financial institutions (which may include any Lender) that are willing to extend a Commitment or, in the case of any such financial institution that is already a Lender, to increase its Commitment (any such financial institution referred to in this Section being called an """"), cause the total Commitments to be increased by such new or incremental Commitments of the Increasing Lenders, in an amount for each Increasing Lender as set forth in such notice; that (i) the aggregate principal amount of any increase in the total Commitments made pursuant to this Section shall not be less than $25,000,000 and the aggregate principal amount of all such increases shall not exceed $200,000,000, (ii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and (iii) each Increasing Lender, if not already a Lender hereunder, shall become a party to this Agreement by completing and delivering to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Accession Agreement.

provided
(A) in the case of an Increasing Lender already a Lender under this Agreement, on the date specified in the applicable notice delivered pursuant to this Section and (B) in the case of an Increasing Lender not already a Lender under this Agreement, on the effective date of the applicable Accession Agreement.  Upon the effectiveness of any Accession Agreement to which any Increasing Lender is a party, such Increasing Lender shall thereafter be deemed to be a party to this Agreement and shall be entitled to all rights,
benefits and privileges accorded a Lender hereunder and subject to all obligations of a Lender hereunder. Upon the effectiveness of any increase pursuant to this Section in the Commitment of a Lender already a party hereto, Schedule 2.01 shall be deemed to have been amended to reflect the increased Commitment of such Lender.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the aggregate Commitments (or in the Commitment of any Lender) shall become effective under this Section unless (i) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents consistent with those delivered under paragraphs (b) and
(c) of Section 4.01 as to the corporate power and authority of the Borrowers to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase and (ii) on the date of such increase, the conditions set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 4.02 shall be satisfied (with all references in such paragraphs to a Borrowing being deemed to be references to such increase and without giving effect to the parenthetical in Section 4.02(a)) and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Company.  Following any extension of a new Commitment or increase of a Lender's Commitment pursuant to this paragraph, any Loans outstanding prior to the effectiveness of such increase or extension shall continue outstanding until the ends of the respective Interests Periods applicable thereto, and shall then be repaid and, if the Borrowers shall so elect, refinanced with new Revolving Loans made pursuant to Section 2.01(a) ratably in accordance with the Commitments in effect following such extension or increase.
SECTION 2.09.   The Company may, by delivery of a Maturity Date Extension Request to the Administrative Agent (which shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders) not less than 45 days and not more than 75 days prior to any anniversary of the Effective Date, request that the Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional period of one year; that there shall be no more than two extensions of the Maturity Date pursuant to this Section.  Each Lender shall, by notice to the Company and the Administrative Agent given not later than the 20th day after the date of the Administrative Agent's receipt of the Company's Maturity Date Extension Request, advise the Company whether or not it agrees to the requested extension (each Lender agreeing to a requested extension being called a """", and each Lender declining to agree to a requested extension being called a """"). Any Lender that has not so advised the Company and the Administrative Agent by such day shall be deemed to have declined to agree to such extension and shall be a Declining Lender.  If Lenders constituting the Required Lenders shall have agreed to a Maturity Date Extension Request, then the Maturity Date shall, as to the Consenting Lenders, be extended to the first anniversary of the Maturity Date theretofore in effect. The decision to agree or withhold agreement to any Maturity Date Extension Request shall be at the sole discretion of each Lender.  The Commitment of any Declining Lender shall terminate on the Maturity Date in effect prior to giving effect to any such extension (such Maturity Date being called the """"). The principal amount of any outstanding Loans made by Declining Lenders, together with any accrued interest thereon and any accrued fees and other amounts payable to or for the account of such Declining Lenders hereunder, shall be due and payable on the Existing Maturity Date, and on the Existing Maturity Date the Borrowers shall also make such other prepayments of their Loans pursuant to Section 2.11 as shall be required in order that, after giving effect to the termination of the Commitments of, and all payments

SECTION 2.14.   If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a LIBOR Borrowing:
Alternate Rate of Interest.
(a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period; or
(b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining the Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the applicable Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or fax as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the applicable Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Revolving Borrowing to, or continuation of any Revolving Borrowing as, an affected LIBOR Borrowing shall be ineffective, (ii) any affected LIBOR Borrowing that is requested to be continued shall be continued as an ABR Borrowing and (ii) any Borrowing Request for an affected LIBOR Borrowing shall be deemed to be a request for an ABR Revolving Borrowing.

(ii) impose on any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the London or European interbank market any other condition affecting this Agreement or LIBOR Loans or any Letter of Credit or participations therein;
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any LIBOR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise), then the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank determines in good faith that any Change in Law regarding capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing Bank's capital or on the capital of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company would have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's or Issuing Bank's policies and the policies of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the applicable Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender's or Issuing Bank's holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) If the cost to any Lender of making or maintaining any Loan or the cost to any Lender or any Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit to a Borrowing Subsidiary is increased (or the amount of any sum
received or receivable by any Lender or any Issuing Bank (or its applicable lending office) is reduced) by an amount deemed in good faith by such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to be material, by reason of the fact that such Borrowing Subsidiary is incorporated in, has its principal place of  business in, or borrows from, a jurisdiction outside the United States, such Borrowing Subsidiary shall indemnify such Lender or such Issuing Bank from time to time for such increased cost or reduction.
(d) A certificate of a Lender or Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a), (b) or (c) of this Section and the manner in which such amount or amounts have been determined, shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Company shall pay or cause the applicable Borrower to pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(e) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation; that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor; that, if the Change in Law or other circumstance giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.

(f) The foregoing provisions of this Section shall not apply to Taxes, which shall be governed solely by Section 2.17.
SECTION 2.16. In the event of (a) the payment of any principal of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or an optional prepayment of Loans), (b) the conversion of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Loan on the date or in the amount specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto or (d) the assignment of any LIBOR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.19, then, in any such event, the applicable Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense (but not for any anticipated profits) attributable to such event. In the case of a LIBOR Loan, such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of
Break Funding Payments.
(i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan (and, for avoidance of doubt, without giving effect to any Applicable Rate that would otherwise have been applicable thereto), for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure
to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan), over (ii) the amount of interest that would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the London interbank market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the applicable Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The applicable Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
SECTION 2.17. (a) Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Credit Party hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes; that if any Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, the applicable Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) such Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) such Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
Taxes.
provided
(b) In addition, the Borrowers shall pay any Other Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.
(c) The relevant Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and each Issuing Bank, within 10 days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of such Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender or an Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or an Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by any Borrower to a Governmental Authority, such Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
(e) Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is resident or
located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times prescribed by applicable law, such properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate; that such Lender has received written notice from the Company advising it of the availability of such exemption or reduction and containing all applicable documentation (together, if requested by such Lender, with a certified English translation thereof). Each Lender shall promptly notify the Company at any time it determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any such previously delivered documentation to the Company.
provided
(f) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by a Borrower or with respect to which a Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this Section, it shall pay over such refund to such Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by such Borrower under this Section with respect to the Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund); , that such Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to such Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to any Borrower or any other Person.
provided
SECTION 2.18. (a) Each Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements or otherwise) prior to the time required hereunder for such payment or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders to such account as the Administrative Agent shall from time to time specify in one or more notices delivered to the Company, except that payments to be made directly to an Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as provided herein shall be so directly made and payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.16, 2.17 and 10.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.  The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, in the case of any payment accruing

interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.  All payments hereunder and under each other Loan Document shall be made in US Dollars.  Any payment required to be made by the Administrative Agent hereunder shall be deemed to have been made by the time required if the Administrative Agent shall, at or before such time, have taken the necessary steps to make such payment in accordance with the regulations or operating procedures of the clearing or settlement system used by the Administrative Agent to make such payment.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Revolving Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Revolving Loans, LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Revolving Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans; that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made by any Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).  Each Credit Party consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against such Credit Party rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of such Credit Party in the amount of such participation.
provided
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of any Lenders or Issuing Bank hereunder that the such Borrower will not
make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the applicable Lenders or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each applicable Lender or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(e), 2.06(b) or 2.18(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.
SECTION 2.19. (a) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Credit Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.
(b) If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Credit Party is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17 or if any Lender is a Declining Lender, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 10.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); that (i) the Company shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, each Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender (which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld), (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts), (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim
provided
for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments and (iv) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a Lender being a Declining Lender, the assignee shall have agreed to the applicable Maturity Date Extension Request.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.20. The Company may at any time and from time to time designate any Subsidiary as a Borrowing Subsidiary by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement executed by such Subsidiary and the Company, and upon such delivery such Subsidiary shall for all purposes of this Agreement be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement until the Company shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent a Borrowing Subsidiary Termination with respect to such Subsidiary, whereupon such Subsidiary shall cease to be a Borrowing Subsidiary and a party to this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no Borrowing Subsidiary Termination will become effective as to any Borrowing Subsidiary at a time when any principal of or interest on any Loan to or any Letter of Credit issued for the account of such Borrowing Subsidiary shall be outstanding hereunder; that such Borrowing Subsidiary Termination shall be effective to terminate the right of such Borrowing Subsidiary to make further Borrowings under this Agreement.  As soon as practicable upon receipt of a Borrowing Subsidiary Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall make a copy thereof available to each Lender.

Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent as its agent and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
The bank serving as Administrative Agent hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth herein.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly contemplated hereby that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.  The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 10.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Administrative Agent shall be deemed to have no knowledge of any Default unless and until written notice thereof is given to the Administrative Agent by the Company or a Lender, and the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered hereunder or in connection herewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein, (iv) the validity, enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument or document or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for any Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by it.  The Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related Parties.  The exculpatory provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Administrative Agent as provided in this paragraph, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Company.  Upon any such resignation, the Company shall have the right, in consultation with the Required Lenders, to appoint a successor.  If no successor shall have been so appointed by the Company and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank.  Upon the acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges
and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder.  The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After the Administrative Agent's resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 10.03 shall continue in effect for the benefit of the retiring Administrative Agent, its sub-agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while it was acting as the Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
In order to induce the Lenders and the Issuing Banks to extend credit to the Borrowing Subsidiaries hereunder, the Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees the payment when and as due of the Obligations of each Borrowing Subsidiary. The Company further agrees that the due and punctual payment of such Obligations may be extended or renewed, in whole or in part, without notice to or further assent from it, and that it will remain bound upon its guarantee hereunder notwithstanding any such extension or renewal of any such Obligation.
The Company waives presentment to, demand of payment from and protest to any Borrowing Subsidiary of any of the Obligations, and also waives notice of acceptance of its obligations and notice of protest for nonpayment.  The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be affected by (a) the failure of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against any Borrowing Subsidiary under the provisions of this Agreement or otherwise; (b) any extension or renewal of any of the Obligations; (c) any rescission, waiver, amendment or modification of, or release from, any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement, or any other agreement; (d) any default, failure or delay, willful or otherwise, in the performance of any of the Obligations; or (e) any other act, omission or delay to do any other act which may or might in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of the Company or otherwise operate as a discharge of a guarantor as a matter of law or equity or which would impair or eliminate any right of the Company to subrogation.
The Company further agrees that its agreement hereunder constitutes a guarantee of payment when due (whether or not any bankruptcy or similar proceeding
shall have stayed the accrual or collection of any of the Obligations or operated as a discharge thereof) and not merely of collection, and waives any right to require that any resort be had by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank to any balance of any deposit account or credit on the books of the Administrative Agent, such Lender or such Issuing Bank in favor of any Borrowing Subsidiary or any other Person.
The obligations of the Company hereunder shall not be subject to any reduction, limitation, impairment or termination for any reason, and shall not be subject to any defense or set-off, counterclaim, recoupment or termination whatsoever, by reason of the invalidity, illegality or unenforceability of any of the Obligations, any impossibility in the performance of any of the Obligations or otherwise.
The Company further agrees that its obligations hereunder shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time payment, or any part thereof, of any Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be restored by the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank upon the bankruptcy or reorganization of any Borrowing Subsidiary or otherwise.
In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation of any other right that the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Issuing Bank may have at law or in equity against the Company by virtue hereof, upon the failure of any Borrowing Subsidiary to pay any Obligation when and as the same shall become due, whether at maturity, by acceleration, after notice of prepayment or otherwise, the Company hereby promises to and will, upon receipt of written demand by the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, forthwith pay, or cause to be paid, to the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank in cash an amount equal to the unpaid principal amount of such Obligation then due, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon.
Upon payment by the Company of any sums as provided above, all rights of the Company against any Borrowing Subsidiary arising as a result thereof by way of right of subrogation or otherwise shall in all respects be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior indefeasible payment in full of all the Obligations owed by such Borrowing Subsidiary to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders.
Nothing shall discharge or satisfy the liability of the Company hereunder except the full and indefeasible performance and payment of the Obligations.

SECTION 10.02. (a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.

Waivers; Amendments.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 14, 2007  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.40 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2007, 10 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.32 billion, 7 percent above last year. Second quarter GAAP net income was $123 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, compared with $115 million, or $0.26 per share, in last year's second quarter.
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $40 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $13 million of tax and other net costs, Agilent reported second quarter adjusted net income of $176 million, or $0.43 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $157 million, or $0.36 per share, one year ago. (1)
""Agilent had another solid performance in this year's second quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Both revenues and earnings were in the middle of our guidance range. As in the first quarter, we saw
1
notable strength across our Bio-Analytical Measurement portfolio, and significant weakness in wireless handset test."" In Q2, revenues were up 7 percent, and adjusted net income per share, at $0.43, was 19 percent above last year's results.
Sullivan noted that the company's Bio-Analytical revenues were up 15 percent, again outpacing all major competitors. ""We're particularly pleased by the initial reception to our second quarter GC and GC/MS platform introductions."" Sullivan also noted that, while Electronic Measurement revenues grew 3 percent, segment growth excluding the impact of a weak handset test market was about 7 percent.
Sullivan added, ""The pick-up in second quarter Electronic Measurement bookings to 8 percent growth, combined with the steady 14 percent growth in Bio-Analytical orders, bodes well for Agilent's prospects in the second half of this year.""
Second quarter Return on Invested Capital(2) reached 25 percent, 2 points better than last year's strong performance, while receivables Days-Sales-Outstanding improved 4 days. Inventory Days-On-Hand, anticipating a stronger second half, increased by 6 days. Cash generated from operating activities was $302 million in the second quarter. During the period, the company repurchased $382 million of its common stock. The company ended the quarter with net cash of $2.1 billion.
For the fiscal third quarter of 2007, Agilent expects revenues of $1.36 billion to $1.40 billion, up 10 percent to 13 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50 per share, 18 percent to 28 percent above last year's comparable earnings. Normal seasonality would suggest fourth quarter revenues roughly 5 percent above the third quarter and an increase in operating earnings of about $0.09 per share. (3)

Segment Results
Bio-Analytical Measurement ($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement orders were up 14 percent in the second quarter from one year ago, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. Revenues of $428 million were up 15 percent from last year, with double- digit growth in all major geographies and strength across the portfolio of instruments, consumables and services. Life Sciences revenues of $194 million were up 20 percent from last year. Sustained momentum of the Liquid Chromatography and LC / MS platform as well as a market leading position in emerging Comparative Genomics Hybridization (CGH) microarray applications drove the second quarter growth of Life Sciences. Chemical Analysis revenues of $234 million were up 11 percent from last year, with environmental spending and forensics showing particular strength. Market reception to the new Gas Chromatography and GC/MS platform has been excellent and above expectations.
(2) improved 6 points to 27 percent.
Segment income from operations of $67 million was $22 million above last year on a $56 million increase in revenues. Gross margins improved by 3 points, while operating margins improved 4 points to 16 percent. Segment Return On Invested Capital
Electronic Measurement ($ millions except where noted)

Second quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $943 million were up 8 percent from last year, double the average of the past four quarters. The pick-up in orders was due to sustained momentum in general purpose test, strength in wireline communications test and a bottoming of the wireless handset test market. Revenues of $892 million were up 3 percent, with Americas up 7 percent and Europe up 9 percent, while demand from Asia was down 3 percent. General Purpose Test revenues were 10 percent ahead of last year while Communications Test, reflecting the weakness in handset test, was off 7 percent from one year ago.
(2) improved 2 points to 25 percent.
Second quarter income from operations of $130 million was up $10 million from last year on a $25 million increase in revenues. Gross margins improved 3 points from last year while operating margins improved less than a point due to increased acquisition-related spending. Segment ROIC

The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the pace of new product introductions and future demand for the Company's products and services; and guidance for the third and fourth quarters and the second half of fiscal year 2007.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on

page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
            
Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q307 and Q407 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. It also excludes the impact of the acquisition of Stratagene, which has not yet been completed. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, expenses related to share-based compensation, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
Our management recognizes that items such as share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
The preliminary adjusted net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.

We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.

Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 14, 2007  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.31 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2007, 7 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.37 billion, 11 percent above last year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $185 million, or $0.45 per diluted share.  Last year's third quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations, which included a $65 million, or $0.15 per share, gain from the sale of assets, was $216 million.
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $27 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $18 million of tax and other net benefits, Agilent reported third quarter adjusted net income of $194 million, or $0.48 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $166 million, or $0.39 per share, one year ago.

""Agilent met its aggressive performance targets despite very divergent market trends during the third quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer.  ""Bio-analytical markets were strong across the board, and the performance of our Segment was even more robust.  Electronic measurement markets were solid in the Americas and Europe but surprisingly weak in Asia, particularly Japan.
""As a result, third quarter revenues were up 11 percent from last year to $1.37 billion, just shy of our revised expectations.  Adjusted net income per share, at $0.48, was 23 percent above last year's results and in the middle of our guidance range.""
Sullivan noted that, including the impact of the third quarter acquisition of Stratagene, Bio-Analytical segment orders were up 21 percent from last year, while revenues hit a record $500 million, up 19 percent from one year ago.  ""Initial integration activities are going well, and we are enthusiastic about the synergy between Stratagene's bio-reagents and Agilent's analytical instruments to better serve customers in both commercial and not-for-profit life sciences applications.""
 reached 28 percent, 3 points better than last year's strong performance.  Both Receivables Days-Sales-Outstanding and Inventory Days-On-Hand improved 3 days from one year ago. Cash generated from operating activities was $176 million in the third quarter. During the period, the company repurchased $677 million of its common stock. The company ended the quarter with net cash of $1.5 billion.
Third quarter Return on Invested Capital

For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, Agilent expects a softer than normal seasonal increase in revenues because of weak Asian electronic measurement markets.  Revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.39 billion to $1.43 billion, up 5 percent to 8 percent from last year. Adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.54 per share, 9 percent to 17 percent above last year's comparable earnings.

Sullivan said, ""Near-term weakness in Asian electronic measurement markets does not dampen our expectations for Agilent's performance in fiscal

2008.  We anticipate continued momentum in our Bio-Analytical markets and a return to more normal secular growth in Electronic Measurement markets next year.  We continue to leverage our robust operating model, and will benefit from our investments in core products, growth initiatives and acquisitions.""

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash stock-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(1)
(2) Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(3) Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q407 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization.  Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, expenses related to share-based compensation, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
Our management recognizes that items such as share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
The preliminary adjusted net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
(a) Agilent return is equal to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $194 million minus net interest income after tax of $18 million. Please see ""Adjusted Net Income and EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of adjusted net income from continuing operations to GAAP income from continuing operations.
(b) Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 15, 2007  Agilent Technologies Inc.
(NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.48 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, 2007, 6 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.45 billion, 9 percent above last year. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $180 million, or $0.46 per diluted share. Last year's fourth quarter GAAP net income from continuing operations was $126 million, or $0.31 per share.
 
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $36 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $10 million of other net adjustments, Agilent reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $206 million, or $0.53 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $190 million, or $0.45 per share, one year ago.
(1)
 
 
""Agilent had a good fiscal fourth quarter, especially considering the continued divergent trends of our markets,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Bio-analytical markets were strong in both Chemical Analysis and Life Sciences, and across all geographies. Electronic measurement markets were very mixed, with strength in aerospace / defense and wireless R&D, a flat profile for wireless handset and electronic manufacturing test, and weakness in computer and semiconductor markets.""
 
Total fourth quarter revenues were up 9 percent from last year to $1.45 billion. Adjusted net income per share, at $0.53, was 18 percent above last year's results and near the top of the $0.50 - $0.54 guidance range.
 
Sullivan noted that the Bio-Analytical segment grew at a double-digit pace for the sixth consecutive quarter, and that the segment operating margin was at a record level. ""We are seeing sustained strength in our new Liquid Chromatograph, Mass Spectroscopy and Gas Chromatograph platforms, and Stratagene integration activities continue to go well. Last week, we announced the acquisition of Velocity11, adding lab automation to our expanding workflow solutions.""
 
""While the Electronic Measurement segment was flat overall, we saw good growth in those areas where we have invested in specific growth initiatives, such as aerospace / defense and wireless R&D,"" said Sullivan.
 
Fourth quarter Return on Invested Capital
(2)
 reached a new high of 30 percent, a point better than last year's strong performance. Both Receivables Days-Sales-Outstanding and Inventory Days-On-Hand reached new historic lows. Cash generated from operating activities was $398 million in the fourth quarter. During the period, the company repurchased $631 million of its common stock, completing its $2 billion buyback program.
 
Full fiscal 2007 revenues grew 9 percent to $5.4 billion. Adjusted net income per share rose 22 percent to $1.82. Return on Invested Capital reached 27 percent, and cash generated from operating activities during fiscal 2007 was $969 million.
 
Said Sullivan, ""Today, Agilent's Board of Directors authorized a new program to repurchase up to $2 billion of Agilent's common shares, reflecting its confidence in Agilent's ability to create superior shareholder value, leveraging our operating model through higher sustainable growth.""
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan said the company was comfortable with the range of analyst estimates for FY2008 revenues and adjusted net income per share.
(3)
 For the fiscal first quarter of 2008, revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.40 billion, up 5 percent to 9 percent from last year.
 
Comparisons of this year's first quarter adjusted net income will be affected by a change in the timing of Agilent's annual compensation awards program, and by a shift toward more variable compensation. Compared to last year, about $32 million more compensation-related expense will be recognized in Q1FY08. That $0.06 per share cost increase will be offset by a $0.04 reduction in Q2 expense, and by $0.01 reductions in FY08's Q3 and Q4. Reflecting this changed pattern of compensation expense, first quarter adjusted net income is expected to be in the range of $0.38 to $0.43 per share, 15 percent to 30 percent above last year's comparable earnings.

Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement orders were up 16 percent during the fourth quarter from one year ago, and up 11 percent excluding the impact of the acquisition of Stratagene. Revenues of $558 million were up 24 percent from last year, and up 19 percent excluding Stratagene. Revenues were strong in both Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis end markets and were well balanced geographically, with all regions up over 20 percent from one year ago.
Life Sciences revenue was up 30 percent from one year ago, and up 17 percent excluding Stratagene. Sustained strength in the pharmaceutical and biotech markets fueled growth of our 1200 Series liquid chromatography, mass spectrometry and LC/MS platforms as well as demand for microarray applications. Participation in the academic & government market more than doubled over the year, and rose 25 percent organically. Chemical Analysis revenues of $322 million were up 20 percent from last year, driven by continued strength in petrochemical, food safety and environmental end markets. Strong market acceptance of the new 7890 gas chromatograph and continued strength of the LC/MS portfolio drove demand in chemical analysis markets.
 
Segment income from operations of $120 million was $29 million above last year on a $108 million increase in revenues. Operating margins improved one point to 21 percent. Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 dropped 3 points to 33 percent because of a 4-point reduction due to the addition of Stratagene.

($ millions except where noted)
 
Fourth quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $912 million were 1 percent above last year. Revenues of $888 million were also up 1 percent, with Americas up 2 percent and Europe up 12 percent, while revenues from Asia were down 4 percent. General Purpose Test revenues were 1 percent ahead of last year, with strength in aerospace / defense offset by weakness in computing and semiconductors. Communications Test revenues were up 1 percent as well, with strength in R&D markets for WiMAX and LTE applications. Handset manufacturing test was down 2 percent from last year.
Fourth quarter income from operations of $133 million was down $4 million from last year on a $10 million increase in revenues. Gross margins were flat with last year while operating margins were off less than a point. Margins were hurt by a $12 million increase in currency-related costs as well as by increased acquisition-related spending. Aggressive asset management enabled segment ROIC

 to remain stable at 27 percent despite lower segment income.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash share-based compensation, intangible amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q108 and full year 2008 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges, non-cash stock-based compensation, and intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter.

Adjusted net income for Q107 of $0.39, adding $32 million of compensation expense, was $0.33 per share.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, expenses related to share-based compensation, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as share-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the Company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the Company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary adjusted net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

Agilent return is equal to adjusted net income from continuing operations of $206 million minus net interest income after tax of $13 million. Please see ""Adjusted Net Income and EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of adjusted net income from continuing operations to GAAP income from continuing operations.

Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c)
Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria. We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments. We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company. We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov., 15, 2007  Agilent Technologies Inc.
(NYSE: A) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved a share-repurchase program of up to $2 billion of its common stock over the next two years.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 13, 2008  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.40 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2008, 12 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.39 billion, 9 percent above last year. First quarter GAAP net income was $120 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. Last year's first quarter GAAP net income was $150 million, or $0.36 per share.
 
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $30 million of share-based compensation expense. Excluding this item and $10 million of other net adjustments, Agilent reported first quarter adjusted net income of $160 million, or $0.42 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $162 million, or $0.39 per share, one year ago.
(1)
 
""Agilent had a good fiscal first quarter, with performance that was very much in line with our expectations,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Revenues of $1.39 billion were up 9 percent from last year, near the high end of guidance.
 
""Bio-Analytical markets showed sustained momentum, with segment orders up 20 percent and revenues up 15 percent, the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit segment growth. Demand remains robust in both life sciences and chemical analysis markets, and across all geographies.
 
""While Electronic Measurement markets remain mixed, we did see some overall improvement compared to prior quarters, with better balance between general purpose and communications markets, and across geographic regions. Segment orders were up 8 percent while revenues were 5 percent ahead of last year.
 
""First quarter adjusted net income per share, at $0.42, was also near the top of our $0.38 - $0.43 guidance range.""
 
 was 23 percent, equal to last year's record first quarter, despite the addition of nearly $390 million of acquisitions. Inventory Days-On-Hand was improved by 3 days from one year ago. During the period, the company repurchased $237 million of its common stock.
First quarter Return on Invested Capital

  For the fiscal second quarter of 2008, revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion, up 6 percent to 10 percent from last year. Second quarter adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.46 to $0.50 per share, 7 percent to 16 percent above last year's comparable earnings.
Looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2008, Sullivan said the company had anticipated some slowing, mainly in U.S. markets, and had planned the year conservatively as a result. Given current trends, Sullivan said the company was still comfortable with the range of analyst estimates for FY2008 revenues and adjusted net income per share.

Revenues were strong in both Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis end markets, and were well balanced geographically, with all regions up double-digit percentages from one year ago.
 
Life Sciences revenue of $241 million was up 24 percent from one year ago, and up 11 percent excluding Stratagene. Pharma and Biotech markets were mixed, up 11 percent, with relative weakness in the U.S. and sustained strength in Asia.  Participation in the academic and government market nearly doubled from last year, and was up 14 percent organically. Chemical Analysis revenue of $316 million was up 9 percent from last year, with weakness in semiconductor-related materials science markets tempering what otherwise would have been an 11 percent growth in Chemical Analysis revenues. Food safety, up 22 percent from last year, as well as environmental and petrochemical markets, continue to be particularly strong on a worldwide basis.
 
 dropped 8 points to 27 percent, with all of the decline due to acquisition-related costs and increased invested capital.
Segment income from operations of $102 million was $9 million above last year on a $73 million increase in revenues; Stratagene boosted revenues by $24 million and reduced segment profits by $2 million during the period.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.

This Form 8-K provides information on the change in the segment reporting of share-based compensation expense by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the ""Company"") and a summary of the effects of this change on the Company's historical segment results. The change in segment reporting will be reflected retrospectively, but in no way revises or restates the GAAP Consolidated Statements of Earnings, Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Shareholders' Equity or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Company and consolidated subsidiaries for any period.
 
by the chief operating decision maker in evaluating the performance of, and in allocating resources to, each of the segments.
Upon the implementation of FASB 123R in the first fiscal quarter ending January 31, 2006, the Company included share-based compensation expenses in its GAAP results but did not include such expenses in its segment reporting.  In order for the Company to be consistent with most publicly traded U.S. companies and to shift greater ownership of these costs to the business segment leadership, it has decided now to include share-based compensation expenses in its segment reporting.  This shift in segment reporting will be used, in part,
 
These changes were effective as of May 1, 2008. All segment financial information, beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2008, will reflect this change. This change in the treatment of share-based compensation expenses will be reflected on a retrospective basis, with the two prior years also adjusted to reflect the change in treatment. The Company is issuing this Form 8-K in order to provide investors with summary financial information and historical data that is on a basis consistent with the Company's new treatment of share-based compensation expenses. Exhibit 99.1 provides quarterly financial summary information by reportable segment for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2007 and for the quarters ending January 31, 2008 and April 30, 2008.

Item 1.01     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
 
As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.
 
Under the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to the Counterparty and Merrill at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement) plus (x) 52 basis points for the period through and including July 16, 2008 and (y) 235 basis points thereafter.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distribution in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of March 17, 2008, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Amended Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the ""Agilent Agreement""), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

3.
    
Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
(a)
  
 
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a ""Confirmation""). The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP number, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth (i) the Purchase Date, (ii) the Purchase Price, (iii) the Repurchase Date, unless the Transaction is to be terminable on demand, (iv) the Pricing Rate or Repurchase Price applicable to the Transaction, and (v) any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction not inconsistent with this Agreement. The Confirmation, together with this Agreement, shall constitute conclusive evidence of the terms agreed between Buyer and Seller with respect to the Transaction to which the Confirmation relates, unless with
(b)
  
respect to the Confirmation specific objection is made promptly after receipt thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Confirmation and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.
 
In the case of Transactions terminable upon demand, such demand shall be made by Buyer or Seller, no later than such time as is customary in accordance with market practice, by telephone or otherwise on or prior to the business day on which such termination will be effective. On the date specified in such demand, or on the date fixed for termination in the case of Transactions having a fixed term, termination of the Transaction will be effected by transfer to Seller or its agent of the Purchased Securities and any Income in respect thereof received by Buyer (and not previously credited or transferred to, or applied to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof) against the transfer of the Repurchase Price to an account of Buyer.
(c)
  
 
4.
    
Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.
 
Events of Default
 
In the event that (i) Seller fails to transfer or Buyer fails to purchase Purchased Securities upon the applicable Purchase Date, (ii) Seller fails to repurchase or Buyer fails to transfer Purchased Securities upon the applicable Repurchase Date, (iii) Seller or Buyer fails to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof, (iv) Buyer fails, after one business day's notice, to comply with Paragraph 5 hereof, (v) an Act of Insolvency occurs with respect to Seller or Buyer, (vi) any representation made by Seller or Buyer shall have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated, or (vii) Seller or Buyer shall admit to the other its inability to, or its intention not to, perform any of its obligations hereunder (each an ""Event of Default""):
 
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities (""Replacement Securities"") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.

(i)

Single Agreement
 
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, and have entered hereinto and will enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance upon the fact that, all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been made in consideration of each other. Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) to perform all of its obligations in respect of each Transaction hereunder, and that a default in the performance of any such obligations shall constitute a default by it in respect of all Transactions hereunder, (ii) that each of them shall be entitled to set off claims and apply property held by them in respect of any Transaction against obligations owing to them in respect of any other Transactions hereunder and (iii) that payments, deliveries and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Transaction shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries and other transfers in respect of any other Transactions hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted.

Non-assignability; Termination
 
The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement and under any Transaction shall not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment without the prior written consent of the other party shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any Transactions shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon giving written notice to the other, except that this Agreement shall, notwithstanding such notice, remain applicable to any Transactions then outstanding.
(a)
  
 
Subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 15 shall not preclude a party from assigning, charging or otherwise dealing with all or any part of its interest in any sum payable to it under Paragraph 11 hereof.
(b)
  
 
16.  Governing Law
 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
 
17.
 
No Waivers, Etc.
 
No express or implied waiver of any Event of Default by either party shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default and no exercise of any remedy hereunder by any party shall constitute a waiver of its right to exercise any other remedy hereunder. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent by any party to a departure here-from shall be effective unless and until such shall be in writing and duly executed by both of the parties hereto. Without limitation on any of the foregoing, the failure to give a notice pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) or 4(b) hereof will not constitute a waiver of any right to do so at a later date.
 
18.
 
Use of Employee Plan Assets
 
If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") are intended to be used by either party hereto (the ""Plan Party"") in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other party prior to the Transaction. The Plan Party shall represent in writing to the other party that the Transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is otherwise exempt therefrom, and the other party may proceed in reliance thereon but shall not be required so to proceed.
(a)
  
Subject to the last sentence of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, any such Transaction shall proceed only if Seller furnishes or has furnished to Buyer its most recent available audited statement of its financial condition and its most recent subsequent unaudited statement of its financial condition.
(b)
  
 
By entering into a Transaction pursuant to this Paragraph, Seller shall be deemed (i) to represent to Buyer that since the date of Seller's latest such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in Seller's financial condition which Seller has not disclosed to Buyer, and (ii) to agree to provide Buyer with future audited and unaudited statements of its financial condition as they are issued, so long as it is a Seller in any outstanding Transaction involving a Plan Party.
(c)

Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).
(d)
  
 
20.
 
Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
 
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated November 16, 2007 in favor of Belmont Funding LLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
 
(a)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Repo Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(b)           any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Repo Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
 
(c)           any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of World Trade or any of its Subsidiaries;

(e)           any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Counterparty that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, World Trade or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Counterparty or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of World Trade or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Counterparty that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against World Trade and (ii) 
 
any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against World Trade unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Repo Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Counterparty herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Repo Agreement.  The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.
 
This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that for the purposes of this paragraph the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and to Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total value received or contemplated to be received by World Trade and/or Agilent in any transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement bears to the fees paid or to be paid to Merrill Lynch with respect to such transaction; , , that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Indemnified Parties be required to contribute in respect of a specific transaction an aggregate amount in excess of the fees actually paid in such transaction to Merrill Lynch.  The foregoing contribution agreement shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at common law or otherwise.  No investigation or failure to investigate by any Indemnified Party shall impair the foregoing indemnification and contribution agreement or any other right an Indemnified Party may have.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that, without Merrill Lynch's prior written consent, neither World Trade nor Agilent nor any of their affiliates or subsidiaries will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement (whether or not Merrill Lynch or any other Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (a) includes an unconditional written release, in form and substance satisfactory to Merrill Lynch and each Indemnified Party, from all liability arising out
 
of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
 
In the event that an Indemnified Party is requested or required to appear as a witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or against Agilent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in which such Indemnified Party is not named as a defendant, World Trade and Agilent agree to reimburse such Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnified Party's appearing and preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its legal counsel.

As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.
 
Under the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to the Counterparty and Merrill at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement) plus (x) 52 basis points for the period through and including July 16, 2008 and (y) 235 basis points thereafter.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distribution in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of March 17, 2008, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Amended Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the ""Agilent Agreement""), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
(a)
  
 
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a ""Confirmation"").

4.
    
Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.
 
Events of Default
 
In the event that (i) Seller fails to transfer or Buyer fails to purchase Purchased Securities upon the applicable Purchase Date, (ii) Seller fails to repurchase or Buyer fails to transfer Purchased Securities upon the applicable Repurchase Date, (iii) Seller or Buyer fails to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof, (iv) Buyer fails, after one business day's notice, to comply with Paragraph 5 hereof, (v) an Act of Insolvency occurs with respect to Seller or Buyer, (vi) any representation made by Seller or Buyer shall have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated, or (vii) Seller or Buyer shall admit to the other its inability to, or its intention not to, perform any of its obligations hereunder (each an ""Event of Default""):
 
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities (""Replacement Securities"") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.

(i)

Single Agreement
 
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, and have entered hereinto and will enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance upon the fact that, all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been made in consideration of each other. Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) to perform all of its obligations in respect of each Transaction hereunder, and that a default in the performance of any such obligations shall constitute a default by it in respect of all Transactions hereunder, (ii) that each of them shall be entitled to set off claims and apply property held by them in respect of any Transaction against obligations owing to them in respect of any other Transactions hereunder and (iii) that payments, deliveries and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Transaction shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries and other transfers in respect of any other Transactions hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted.

14.
 
Entire Agreement; Severability

15.
 
Non-assignability; Termination
 
The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement and under any Transaction shall not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment without the prior written consent of the other party shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any Transactions shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon giving written notice to the other, except that this Agreement shall, notwithstanding such notice, remain applicable to any Transactions then outstanding.
(a)
  
 
Subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 15 shall not preclude a party from assigning, charging or otherwise dealing with all or any part of its interest in any sum payable to it under Paragraph 11 hereof.

16.  Governing Law
 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
 
17.
 
No Waivers, Etc.
 
No express or implied waiver of any Event of Default by either party shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default and no exercise of any remedy hereunder by any party shall constitute a waiver of its right to exercise any other remedy hereunder. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent by any party to a departure here-from shall be effective unless and until such shall be in writing and duly executed by both of the parties hereto. Without limitation on any of the foregoing, the failure to give a notice pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) or 4(b) hereof will not constitute a waiver of any right to do so at a later date.
 
18.
 
Use of Employee Plan Assets
 
If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") are intended to be used by either party hereto (the ""Plan Party"") in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other party prior to the Transaction. The Plan Party shall represent in writing to the other party that the Transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is otherwise exempt therefrom, and the other party may proceed in reliance thereon but shall not be required so to proceed.
(a)
  
Subject to the last sentence of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, any such Transaction shall proceed only if Seller furnishes or has furnished to Buyer its most recent available audited statement of its financial condition and its most recent subsequent unaudited statement of its financial condition.
(b)
  
 
By entering into a Transaction pursuant to this Paragraph, Seller shall be deemed (i) to represent to Buyer that since the date of Seller's latest such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in Seller's financial condition which Seller has not disclosed to Buyer, and (ii) to agree to provide Buyer with future audited and unaudited statements of its financial condition as they are issued, so long as it is a Seller in any outstanding Transaction involving a Plan Party.
(c)
  
 
19.
 
Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).
(d)
  
 
20.
 
Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
 
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated November 16, 2007 in favor of Belmont Funding LLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:

The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.

Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
 
In the event that an Indemnified Party is requested or required to appear as a witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or against Agilent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in which such Indemnified Party is not named as a defendant, World Trade and Agilent agree to reimburse such Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnified Party's appearing and preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its legal counsel.

As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.
 
Under the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to the Counterparty and Merrill at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement) plus (x) 52 basis points for the period through and including July 16, 2008 and (y) 235 basis points thereafter.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distribution in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of March 17, 2008, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Amended Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the ""Agilent Agreement""), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.

Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.

The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities (""Replacement Securities"") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder.

The nondefaulting party shall have, in addition to its rights hereunder, any rights otherwise available to it under any other agreement or applicable law.
(i)

Single Agreement
 
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, and have entered hereinto and will enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance upon the fact that, all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been made in consideration of each other. Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) to perform all of its obligations in respect of each Transaction hereunder, and that a default in the performance of any such obligations shall constitute a default by it in respect of all Transactions hereunder, (ii) that each of them shall be entitled to set off claims and apply property held by them in respect of any Transaction against obligations owing to them in respect of any other Transactions hereunder and (iii) that payments, deliveries and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Transaction shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries and other transfers in respect of any other Transactions hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted.

Entire Agreement; Severability

15.
 
Non-assignability; Termination
 
The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement and under any Transaction shall not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment without the prior written consent of the other party shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any Transactions shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon giving written notice to the other, except that this Agreement shall, notwithstanding such notice, remain applicable to any Transactions then outstanding.

This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
 
17.
 
No Waivers, Etc.
 
No express or implied waiver of any Event of Default by either party shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default and no exercise of any remedy hereunder by any party shall constitute a waiver of its right to exercise any other remedy hereunder. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent by any party to a departure here-from shall be effective unless and until such shall be in writing and duly executed by both of the parties hereto. Without limitation on any of the foregoing, the failure to give a notice pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) or 4(b) hereof will not constitute a waiver of any right to do so at a later date.
 
18.
 
Use of Employee Plan Assets
 
If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") are intended to be used by either party hereto (the ""Plan Party"") in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other party prior to the Transaction. The Plan Party shall represent in writing to the other party that the Transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is otherwise exempt therefrom, and the other party may proceed in reliance thereon but shall not be required so to proceed.

Subject to the last sentence of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, any such Transaction shall proceed only if Seller furnishes or has furnished to Buyer its most recent available audited statement of its financial condition and its most recent subsequent unaudited statement of its financial condition.
(b)
  
 
By entering into a Transaction pursuant to this Paragraph, Seller shall be deemed (i) to represent to Buyer that since the date of Seller's latest such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in Seller's financial condition which Seller has not disclosed to Buyer, and (ii) to agree to provide Buyer with future audited and unaudited statements of its financial condition as they are issued, so long as it is a Seller in any outstanding Transaction involving a Plan Party.
(c)
  
 
19.
 
Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).
(d)
  
 
20.
 
Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
 
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

Guaranteed Obligations
 
This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated November 16, 2007 in favor of Belmont Funding LLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
 
(a)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Repo Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(b)           any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Repo Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
 
(c)           any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of World Trade or any of its Subsidiaries;
 
(d)           any failure of the Counterparty to disclose to World Trade or the Guarantor any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Guarantor or World Trade, as the case may be, now or hereafter known to the Counterparty (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Counterparty to disclose such information); or
 
(e)           any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Counterparty that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, World Trade or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Counterparty or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of World Trade or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Counterparty that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against World Trade and (ii) 
 
any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against World Trade unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Repo Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Counterparty herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Repo Agreement.  The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.
 
This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that for the purposes of this paragraph the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and to Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total value received or contemplated to be received by World Trade and/or Agilent in any transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement bears to the fees paid or to be paid to Merrill Lynch with respect to such transaction; , , that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Indemnified Parties be required to contribute in respect of a specific transaction an aggregate amount in excess of the fees actually paid in such transaction to Merrill Lynch.

of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.
 
Under the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to the Counterparty and Merrill at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement) plus (x) 52 basis points for the period through and including July 16, 2008 and (y) 235 basis points thereafter.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distribution in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of March 17, 2008, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Amended Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the ""Agilent Agreement""), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.  
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.

Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
(a)
  
 
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a ""Confirmation""). The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP number, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth (i) the Purchase Date, (ii) the Purchase Price, (iii) the Repurchase Date, unless the Transaction is to be terminable on demand, (iv) the Pricing Rate or Repurchase Price applicable to the Transaction, and (v) any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction not inconsistent with this Agreement.

In the case of Transactions terminable upon demand, such demand shall be made by Buyer or Seller, no later than such time as is customary in accordance with market practice, by telephone or otherwise on or prior to the business day on which such termination will be effective.

(c)
  
 
4.
    
Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.

Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).

Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections

in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantor's liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the Guaranteed Obligations and would be owed by World Trade to the Counterparty under or in respect of the Repo Agreement but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving World Trade.
FOR VALUE RECEIVED, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, AGILENT TECHNOLOGIES, INC., a corporation duly organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware (the """") hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to
Guarantor

Repo Agreement
Guaranteed Obligations
 
This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated November 16, 2007 in favor of Belmont Funding LLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
 
(a)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Repo Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(b)           any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Repo Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
 
(c)           any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of World Trade or any of its Subsidiaries;
 
(d)           any failure of the Counterparty to disclose to World Trade or the Guarantor any information relating to the business, condition (financial or otherwise), operations, performance, properties or prospects of the Guarantor or World Trade, as the case may be, now or hereafter known to the Counterparty (the Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Counterparty to disclose such information); or
 
(e)           any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Counterparty that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, World Trade or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Counterparty or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of World Trade or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Counterparty that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against World Trade and (ii) 
 
any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against World Trade unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Repo Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Counterparty herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Repo Agreement.  The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.
 
This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.
 
[THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]
 
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Guarantor has caused this Guaranty to be executed in its corporate name by its duly authorized representative on and as of June 27, 2008.

of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.

As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.
 
Under the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement, World Trade is obligated to make aggregate quarterly payments to the Counterparty and Merrill at a rate per annum equal to the three-month LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Amended Repurchase Agreement and Amended Related Agreement) plus (x) 52 basis points for the period through and including July 16, 2008 and (y) 235 basis points thereafter.  World Trade is entitled to receive from the Counterparty from time to time amounts equal to all dividends and other distribution in respect of the Purchased Securities.
 
Pursuant to the Third Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc., dated as of March 17, 2008, Agilent has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed to the Counterparty the timely payment of all obligations of World Trade under the Amended Repurchase Agreement.
 
In addition, Agilent and World Trade entered into the Agilent Agreement, dated as of January 27, 2006 (the ""Agilent Agreement""), which remains unchanged, in favor of the Counterparty and certain other parties, regarding certain representations, warranties and covenants of Agilent and World Trade with respect to each and with respect to AT Cayco and certain other subsidiaries of Agilent.
 
A copy of the aforementioned agreements (excluding the Agilent Agreement, which was previously filed) are included herein as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2, 99.3 and 99.4 and are incorporated by reference into this Item 1.01.  
The foregoing descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of the agreements.

3.
    
Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
(a)
  
 
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a ""Confirmation""). The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP number, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth (i) the Purchase Date, (ii) the Purchase Price, (iii) the Repurchase Date, unless the Transaction is to be terminable on demand, (iv) the Pricing Rate or Repurchase Price applicable to the Transaction, and (v) any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction not inconsistent with this Agreement.

(b)
  
respect to the Confirmation specific objection is made promptly after receipt thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Confirmation and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.
 
In the case of Transactions terminable upon demand, such demand shall be made by Buyer or Seller, no later than such time as is customary in accordance with market practice, by telephone or otherwise on or prior to the business day on which such termination will be effective. On the date specified in such demand, or on the date fixed for termination in the case of Transactions having a fixed term, termination of the Transaction will be effected by transfer to Seller or its agent of the Purchased Securities and any Income in respect thereof received by Buyer (and not previously credited or transferred to, or applied to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof) against the transfer of the Repurchase Price to an account of Buyer.
(c)
  
 
4.
    
Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.
 
Events of Default
 
In the event that (i) Seller fails to transfer or Buyer fails to purchase Purchased Securities upon the applicable Purchase Date, (ii) Seller fails to repurchase or Buyer fails to transfer Purchased Securities upon the applicable Repurchase Date, (iii) Seller or Buyer fails to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof, (iv) Buyer fails, after one business day's notice, to comply with Paragraph 5 hereof, (v) an Act of Insolvency occurs with respect to Seller or Buyer, (vi) any representation made by Seller or Buyer shall have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated, or (vii) Seller or Buyer shall admit to the other its inability to, or its intention not to, perform any of its obligations hereunder (each an ""Event of Default""):
 
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities (""Replacement Securities"") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.
(h)
  
 
The nondefaulting party shall have, in addition to its rights hereunder, any rights otherwise available to it under any other agreement or applicable law.
(i)
   
 
12.

Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).

Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections

in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

Guaranteed Obligations
 
This agreement amends and restates in its entirety as of the date hereof the Amended and Restated Guaranty of Agilent Technologies, Inc. dated November 16, 2007 in favor of Belmont Funding LLC.
 
The Guarantor guarantees that the Guaranteed Obligations will be paid strictly in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement, regardless of any law, regulation or order now or hereafter in effect in any jurisdiction affecting any of such terms or the rights of the Counterparty with respect thereto.  The obligations of the Guarantor under or in respect of this Guaranty are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations of World Trade under or in respect of the Repo Agreement, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against the Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty, irrespective of whether any action is brought against World Trade or whether World Trade is joined in any such action or actions.  The liability of the Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be irrevocable, absolute and unconditional irrespective of, and the Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to, any or all of the following:
 
 
(a)           any lack of validity or enforceability of the Repo Agreement or any agreement or instrument relating thereto;
 
(b)           any change in the time, manner or place of payment of, or in any other term of, all or any of the Guaranteed Obligations or any other amendment or waiver of or any consent to departure from the Repo Agreement, including, without limitation, any increase in the Guaranteed Obligations or otherwise;
 
(c)           any change, restructuring or termination of the corporate structure or existence of World Trade or any of its Subsidiaries;

(e)           any other circumstance (including, without limitation, any statute of limitations) or any existence of or reliance on any representation by the Counterparty that might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or a discharge of, World Trade or the Guarantor or any other guarantor or surety.
 
This Guaranty shall continue to be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the Counterparty or any other Person upon the insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization of World Trade or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives promptness, diligence, notice of acceptance, presentment, demand for performance, notice of nonperformance, default, acceleration, protest or dishonor and any other notice with respect to any of the Guaranteed Obligations and this Guaranty and any requirement that the Counterparty exhaust any right or take any action against World Trade or any other Person or any Purchased Securities.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives any right to revoke this Guaranty and acknowledges that this Guaranty is continuing in nature and applies to all Guaranteed Obligations, whether existing now or in the future.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably waives (i) any defense arising by reason of any claim or defense based upon an election of remedies by the Counterparty that in any manner impairs, reduces, releases or otherwise adversely affects the subrogation, reimbursement, exoneration, contribution or indemnification rights of the Guarantor or other rights of the Guarantor to proceed against World Trade and (ii) 
 
any defense based on any right of set-off or counterclaim against or in respect of the obligations of the Guarantor hereunder.
 
The Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably agrees not to exercise any rights that it may now have or hereafter acquire against World Trade unless and until all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash.  If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Counterparty, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Counterparty in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Repo Agreement.  If (i) the Guarantor shall make payment to the Counterparty of all or any part of the Guaranteed Obligations, and (ii) all of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty shall have been paid in full in cash, the Counterparty will, at the Guarantor's request and expense, execute and deliver to the Guarantor appropriate documents, without recourse and without representation or warranty, necessary to evidence the transfer by subrogation to the Guarantor of an interest in the Guaranteed Obligations resulting from such payment made by the Guarantor pursuant to this Guaranty.
 
This Guaranty is a continuing guaranty and shall (a) remain in full force and effect until the payment in full in cash of the Guaranteed Obligations and all other amounts payable under this Guaranty, (b) be binding upon the Guarantor, its successors and assigns and (c) inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Counterparty and its successors, permitted transferees and permitted assigns.  Without limiting the generality of clause (c) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Counterparty may assign or otherwise transfer all or any portion of its rights and obligations under the Repo Agreement to any other Person, and such other Person shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to the Counterparty herein or otherwise, in each case as and to the extent provided in the Repo Agreement.  The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.
 
This Guaranty shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York.

expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising from any of the matters referred to in the preceding sentence, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party and whether or not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of World Trade or Agilent or the relevant issuer or whether or not resulting in any liability.  Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

As reported pursuant to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Agilent Technologies, Inc. (""Agilent"") with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 2, 2006 (the ""Original Form 8-K""), on January 27, 2006, Agilent Technologies World Trade, Inc. (""World Trade""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Agilent, entered into a Master Repurchase Agreement and related Confirmation  (together, the ""Original Repurchase Agreement"") with Fenway Capital, LLC (""Fenway""), as counterparty in such transaction (Fenway and its successors and assigns in such capacity, the ""Counterparty""), pursuant to which World Trade sold to the Counterparty, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 billion, 15,000 Class A Preferred Shares of its wholly-owned subsidiary, Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (the ""Purchased Securities""), having an aggregate liquidation preference of $1.5 billion.  Agilent Technologies (Cayco) Limited (""AT Cayco"") is an entity distinct from Agilent and its other subsidiaries, with separate assets and liabilities.  On September 10, 2007, World Trade entered into an amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement and certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Ebbets Funding PLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. (""Merrill"").
 
On November 16, 2007, World Trade entered into a further amendment to the Original Repurchase Agreement (as amended, the ""Repurchase Agreement""), certain of the related agreements and a Novation Agreement in order to substitute Belmont Funding LLC as Counterparty, at the request of Merrill.  On December 7, 2007, World Trade and Agilent entered into an amendment to the Second Amended and Restated Related Agreement dated November 16, 2007 (the ""Related Agreement""), with Merrill to amend certain rights and obligations of the parties thereunder.
 
Pursuant to the Related Agreement, as amended on December 7, 2007, Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agreed that at any time following February 5, 2008, Merrill could designate an Accelerated Repurchase Date under the Repurchase Agreement with respect to all or a portion of the Purchased Securities (the ""Merrill Lynch Notice""), which repurchase date could be no earlier than 120 days from the date of such notice.
 
On March 18, 2008, World Trade received a Merrill Lynch Notice advising World Trade that Merrill had accelerated to July 16, 2008 the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into a Novation Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2008, in order to substitute Steers Repo Pass-Thru Trust, 2008-1 as counterparty, at the request of Merrill.
 
On June 27, 2008, World Trade entered into further amendments to the Repurchase Agreement (the ""Amended Repurchase Agreement""), the Related Agreement (the ""Amended Related Agreement"") and certain of the related agreements.  The material terms of the transaction are as follows:
 
Pursuant to the Amended Related Agreement, Agilent and World Trade have jointly and severally agreed that (i) the obligation of World Trade to repurchase the Purchased Securities has been extended from July 16, 2008 to November 17, 2008, and (ii) World Trade has the right to accelerate the date of repurchase of all or any portion of the Purchased Securities from November 17, 2008 to September 19, 2008, provided that World Trade provides notice to Merrill by August 14, 2008.

3.
    
Initiation; Confirmation; Termination
 
An agreement to enter into a Transaction may be made orally or in writing at the initiation of either Buyer or Seller. On the Purchase Date for the Transaction, the Purchased Securities shall be transferred to Buyer or its agent against the transfer of the Purchase Price to an account of Seller.
(a)
  
 
Upon agreeing to enter into a Transaction hereunder, Buyer or Seller (or both), as shall be agreed, shall promptly deliver to the other party a written confirmation of each Transaction (a ""Confirmation""). The Confirmation shall describe the Purchased Securities (including CUSIP number, if any), identify Buyer and Seller and set forth (i) the Purchase Date, (ii) the Purchase Price, (iii) the Repurchase Date, unless the Transaction is to be terminable on demand, (iv) the Pricing Rate or Repurchase Price applicable to the Transaction, and (v) any additional terms or conditions of the Transaction not inconsistent with this Agreement. The Confirmation, together with this Agreement, shall constitute conclusive evidence of the terms agreed between Buyer and Seller with respect to the Transaction to which the Confirmation relates, unless with
(b)
  
respect to the Confirmation specific objection is made promptly after receipt thereof. In the event of any conflict between the terms of such Confirmation and this Agreement, this Agreement shall prevail.
 
In the case of Transactions terminable upon demand, such demand shall be made by Buyer or Seller, no later than such time as is customary in accordance with market practice, by telephone or otherwise on or prior to the business day on which such termination will be effective. On the date specified in such demand, or on the date fixed for termination in the case of Transactions having a fixed term, termination of the Transaction will be effected by transfer to Seller or its agent of the Purchased Securities and any Income in respect thereof received by Buyer (and not previously credited or transferred to, or applied to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof) against the transfer of the Repurchase Price to an account of Buyer.
(c)
  
 
4.
    
Margin Maintenance
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Buyer is less than the aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount for all such Transactions (a ""Margin Deficit""), then Buyer may by notice to Seller require Seller in such Transactions, at Seller's option, to transfer to Buyer cash or additional Securities reasonably acceptable to Buyer (""Additional Purchased Securities""), so that the cash and aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, including any such Additional Purchased Securities, will thereupon equal or exceed such aggregate Buyer's Margin Amount (decreased by the amount of any Margin Deficit as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Buyer is acting as Seller).
(a)
  
 
If at any time the aggregate Market Value of all Purchased Securities subject to all Transactions in which a particular party hereto is acting as Seller exceeds the aggregate Seller's Margin Amount for all such Transactions at such time (a ""Margin Excess""), then Seller may by notice to Buyer require Buyer in such Transactions, at Buyer's option, to transfer cash or Purchased Securities to Seller, so that the aggregate Market Value of the Purchased Securities, after deduction of any such cash or any Purchased Securities so transferred, will thereupon not exceed such aggregate Seller's Margin Amount (increased by the amount of any Margin Excess as of such date arising from any Transactions in which such Seller is acting as Buyer).
(b)
  
 
If any notice is given by Buyer or Seller under subparagraph (a) or (b) of this Paragraph at or before the Margin Notice Deadline on any business day, the party receiving such notice shall transfer cash or Additional Purchased Securities as provided in such subparagraph no later than the close of business in the relevant market on such day. If any such notice is given after the Margin Notice Deadline, the party receiving such notice shall transfer such cash or Securities no later than the close of business in the relevant market on the next business day following such notice.
(c)
  
 
Any cash transferred pursuant to this Paragraph shall be attributed to such Transactions as shall be agreed upon by Buyer and Seller.
(d)
  
(e)   Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer or Seller (or both) under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph may be exercised only where a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess, as the case may be, exceeds a specified dollar amount or a specified percentage of the Repurchase Prices for such Transactions (which amount or percentage shall be agreed to by Buyer and Seller prior to entering into any such Transactions).
 
Seller and Buyer may agree, with respect to any or all Transactions hereunder, that the respective rights of Buyer and Seller under subparagraphs (a) and (b) of this Paragraph to require the elimination of a Margin Deficit or a Margin Excess, as the case may be, may be exercised whenever such a Margin Deficit or Margin Excess exists with respect to any single Transaction hereunder (calculated without regard to any other Transaction outstanding under this Agreement).
(f)
   
 
5.
    
Income Payments
 
Seller shall be entitled to receive an amount equal to all Income paid or distributed on or in respect of the Securities that is not otherwise received by Seller, to the full extent it would be so entitled if the Securities had not been sold to Buyer. Buyer shall, as the parties may agree with respect to any Transaction (or, in the absence of any such agreement, as Buyer shall reasonably determine in its discretion), on the date such Income is paid or distributed either (i) transfer to or credit to the account of Seller such Income with respect to any Purchased Securities subject to such Transaction or (ii) with respect to Income paid in cash, apply the Income payment or payments to reduce the amount, if any, to be transferred to Buyer by Seller upon termination of such Transaction. Buyer shall not be obligated to take any action pursuant to the preceding sentence (A) to the extent that such action would result in the creation of a Margin Deficit, unless prior thereto or simultaneously therewith Seller transfers to Buyer cash or Additional Purchased Securities sufficient to eliminate such Margin Deficit, or (B) if an Event of Default with respect to Seller has occurred and is then continuing at the time such Income is paid or distributed.
 
6.
    
Security Interest
 
Although the parties intend that all Transactions hereunder be sales and purchases and not loans, in the event any such Transactions are deemed to be loans, Seller shall be deemed to have pledged to Buyer as security for the performance by Seller of its obligations under each such Transaction, and shall be deemed to have granted to Buyer a security interest in, all of the Purchased Securities with respect to all Transactions hereunder and all Income thereon and other proceeds thereof.
 
7.
    
Payment and Transfer
 
Unless otherwise mutually agreed, all transfers of funds hereunder shall be in immediately available funds. All Securities transferred by one party hereto to the other party (i) shall be in suitable form for transfer or shall be accompanied by duly executed instruments of transfer or assignment in blank and such other documentation as the party receiving possession may reasonably request, (ii) shall be transferred on the book-entry system of a Federal Reserve Bank, or (iii) shall be transferred by any other method mutually acceptable to Seller and Buyer.
8.
    
Segregation of Purchased Securities
 
To the extent required by applicable law, all Purchased Securities in the possession of Seller shall be segregated from other securities in its possession and shall be identified as subject to this Agreement. Segregation may be accomplished by appropriate identification on the books and records of the holder, including a financial or securities intermediary or a clearing corporation. All of Seller's interest in the Purchased Securities shall pass to Buyer on the Purchase Date and, unless otherwise agreed by Buyer and Seller, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Buyer from engaging in repurchase transactions with the Purchased Securities or otherwise selling, transferring, pledging or hypothecating the Purchased Securities, but no such transaction shall relieve Buyer of its obligations to transfer Purchased Securities to Seller pursuant to Paragraph 3, 4 or 11 hereof, or of Buyer's obligation to credit or pay Income to, or apply Income to the obligations of, Seller pursuant to Paragraph 5 hereof.
 
Required Disclosure for Transactions in Which the Seller Retains Custody of the Purchased Securities
 
Seller is not permitted to substitute other securities for those subject to this Agreement and therefore must keep Buyer's securities segregated at all times, unless in this Agreement Buyer grants Seller the right to substitute other securities. If Buyer grants the right to substitute, this means that Buyer's securities will likely be commingled with Seller's own securities during the trading day. Buyer is advised that, during any trading day that Buyer's securities are commingled with Seller's securities, they [will]* [may]** be subject to liens granted by Seller to [its clearing bank]* [third parties]** and may be used by Seller for deliveries on other securities transactions. Whenever the securities are commingled, Seller's ability to resegregate substitute securities for Buyer will be subject to Seller's ability to satisfy [the clearing]* [any]** lien or to obtain substitute securities.
 
* Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.4(e) if Seller is a government securities broker or dealer other than a financial institution.
 
** Language to be used under 17 C.F.R. 403.5(d) if Seller is a financial institution.
 
9.
  
Substitution
 
Seller may, subject to agreement with and acceptance by Buyer, substitute other Securities for any Purchased Securities. Such substitution shall be made by transfer to Buyer of such other Securities and transfer to Seller of such Purchased Securities. After substitution, the substituted Securities shall be deemed to be Purchased Securities.
(a)
  
 
In Transactions in which Seller retains custody of Purchased Securities, the parties expressly agree that Buyer shall be deemed, for purposes of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, to have agreed to and accepted in this Agreement substitution by Seller of other Securities for Purchased Securities; provided, however, that such other Securities shall have a Market Value at least equal to the Market Value of the Purchased Securities for which they are substituted.
(b)
  
10.
 
Representations
 
Each of Buyer and Seller represents and warrants to the other that (i) it is duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement, to enter into Transactions contemplated hereunder and to perform its obligations hereunder and has taken all necessary action to authorize such execution, delivery and performance, (ii) it will engage in such Transactions as principal (or, if agreed in writing, in the form of an annex hereto or otherwise, in advance of any Transaction by the other party hereto, as agent for a disclosed principal), (iii) the person signing this Agreement on its behalf is duly authorized to do so on its behalf (or on behalf of any such disclosed principal), (iv) it has obtained all authorizations of any governmental body required in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder and such authorizations are in full force and effect and (v) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Transactions hereunder will not violate any law, ordinance, charter, bylaw or rule applicable to it or any agreement by which it is bound or by which any of its assets are affected. On the Purchase Date for any Transaction Buyer and Seller shall each be deemed to repeat all the foregoing representations made by it.
 
11.
 
Events of Default
 
In the event that (i) Seller fails to transfer or Buyer fails to purchase Purchased Securities upon the applicable Purchase Date, (ii) Seller fails to repurchase or Buyer fails to transfer Purchased Securities upon the applicable Repurchase Date, (iii) Seller or Buyer fails to comply with Paragraph 4 hereof, (iv) Buyer fails, after one business day's notice, to comply with Paragraph 5 hereof, (v) an Act of Insolvency occurs with respect to Seller or Buyer, (vi) any representation made by Seller or Buyer shall have been incorrect or untrue in any material respect when made or repeated or deemed to have been made or repeated, or (vii) Seller or Buyer shall admit to the other its inability to, or its intention not to, perform any of its obligations hereunder (each an ""Event of Default""):
 
The nondefaulting party may, at its option (which option shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency), declare an Event of Default to have occurred hereunder and, upon the exercise or deemed exercise of such option, the Repurchase Date for each Transaction hereunder shall, if it has not already occurred, be deemed immediately to occur (except that, in the event that the Purchase Date for any Transaction has not yet occurred as of the date of such exercise or deemed exercise, such Transaction shall be deemed immediately canceled). The nondefaulting party shall (except upon the occurrence of an Act of Insolvency) give notice to the defaulting party of the exercise of such option as promptly as practicable.
(a)
  
 
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, if the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, (i) the defaulting party's obligations in such Transactions to repurchase all Purchased Securities, at the Repurchase Price therefor on the Repurchase Date determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, shall thereupon become immediately due and payable, (ii) all Income paid after such exercise or deemed exercise shall be retained by the nondefaulting party and applied to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, and (iii) the defaulting party shall immediately deliver to the nondefaulting party any Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions then in the defaulting party's possession or control.
(b)
  
In all Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, upon tender by the nondefaulting party of payment of the aggregate Repurchase Prices for all such Transactions, all right, title and interest in and entitlement to all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions shall be deemed transferred to the nondefaulting party, and the defaulting party shall deliver all such Purchased Securities to the nondefaulting party.
(c)
  
 
If the nondefaulting party exercises or is deemed to have exercised the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, the nondefaulting party, without prior notice to the defaulting party, may:
(d)
  
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Seller, (A) immediately sell, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, any or all Purchased Securities subject to such Transactions and apply the proceeds thereof to the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of selling all or a portion of such Purchased Securities, to give the defaulting party credit for such Purchased Securities in an amount equal to the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing bid quotation from such a source, against the aggregate unpaid Repurchase Prices and any other amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder; and
(i)
   
 
as to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, (A) immediately purchase, in a recognized market (or otherwise in a commercially reasonable manner) at such price or prices as the nondefaulting party may reasonably deem satisfactory, securities (""Replacement Securities"") of the same class and amount as any Purchased Securities that are not delivered by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party as required hereunder or (B) in its sole discretion elect, in lieu of purchasing Replacement Securities, to be deemed to have purchased Replacement Securities at the price therefor on such date, obtained from a generally recognized source or the most recent closing offer quotation from such a source.
(ii)
  
 
Unless otherwise provided in Annex I, the parties acknowledge and agree that (1) the Securities subject to any Transaction hereunder are instruments traded in a recognized market, (2) in the absence of a generally recognized source for prices or bid or offer quotations for any Security, the nondefaulting party may establish the source therefor in its sole discretion and (3) all prices, bids and offers shall be determined together with accrued Income (except to the extent contrary to market practice with respect to the relevant Securities).
 
As to Transactions in which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer, the defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for any excess of the price paid (or deemed paid) by the nondefaulting party for Replacement Securities over the Repurchase Price for the Purchased Securities replaced thereby and for any amounts payable by the defaulting party under Paragraph 5 hereof or otherwise hereunder.
(e)
  
 
For purposes of this Paragraph 11, the Repurchase Price for each Transaction hereunder in respect of which the defaulting party is acting as Buyer shall not increase above the
(f)
   
amount of such Repurchase Price for such Transaction determined as of the date of the exercise or deemed exercise by the nondefaulting party of the option referred to in subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph.
 
The defaulting party shall be liable to the nondefaulting party for (i) the amount of all reasonable legal or other expenses incurred by the nondefaulting party in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, (ii) damages in an amount equal to the cost (including all fees, expenses and commissions) of entering into replacement transactions and entering into or terminating hedge transactions in connection with or as a result of an Event of Default, and (iii) any other loss, damage, cost or expense directly arising or resulting from the occurrence of an Event of Default in respect of a Transaction.
(g)
  
 
To the extent permitted by applicable law, the defaulting party shall be liable to the non-defaulting party for interest on any amounts owing by the defaulting party hereunder, from the date the defaulting party becomes liable for such amounts hereunder until such amounts are (i) paid in full by the defaulting party or (ii) satisfied in full by the exercise of the nondefaulting party's rights hereunder. Interest on any sum payable by the defaulting party to the nondefaulting party under this Paragraph 11(h) shall be at a rate equal to the greater of the Pricing Rate for the relevant Transaction or the Prime Rate.
(h)
  
 
The nondefaulting party shall have, in addition to its rights hereunder, any rights otherwise available to it under any other agreement or applicable law.
(i)
   
 
12.
 
Single Agreement
 
Buyer and Seller acknowledge that, and have entered hereinto and will enter into each Transaction hereunder in consideration of and in reliance upon the fact that, all Transactions hereunder constitute a single business and contractual relationship and have been made in consideration of each other. Accordingly, each of Buyer and Seller agrees (i) to perform all of its obligations in respect of each Transaction hereunder, and that a default in the performance of any such obligations shall constitute a default by it in respect of all Transactions hereunder, (ii) that each of them shall be entitled to set off claims and apply property held by them in respect of any Transaction against obligations owing to them in respect of any other Transactions hereunder and (iii) that payments, deliveries and other transfers made by either of them in respect of any Transaction shall be deemed to have been made in consideration of payments, deliveries and other transfers in respect of any other Transactions hereunder, and the obligations to make any such payments, deliveries and other transfers may be applied against each other and netted.
 
13.
 
Notices and Other Communications
 
Any and all notices, statements, demands or other communications hereunder may be given by a party to the other by mail, facsimile, telegraph, messenger or otherwise to the address specified in Annex II hereto, or so sent to such party at any other place specified in a notice of change of address hereafter received by the other. All notices, demands and requests hereunder may be made orally, to be confirmed promptly in writing, or by other communication as specified in the preceding sentence.
14.
 
Entire Agreement; Severability
 
This Agreement shall supersede any existing agreements between the parties containing general terms and conditions for repurchase transactions. Each provision and agreement herein shall be treated as separate and independent from any other provision or agreement herein and shall be enforceable notwithstanding the unenforceability of any such other provision or agreement.
 
15.
 
Non-assignability; Termination
 
The rights and obligations of the parties under this Agreement and under any Transaction shall not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment without the prior written consent of the other party shall be null and void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement and any Transactions shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement may be terminated by either party upon giving written notice to the other, except that this Agreement shall, notwithstanding such notice, remain applicable to any Transactions then outstanding.
(a)
  
 
Subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph 15 shall not preclude a party from assigning, charging or otherwise dealing with all or any part of its interest in any sum payable to it under Paragraph 11 hereof.
(b)
  
 
16.  Governing Law
 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to the conflict of law principles thereof.
 
17.
 
No Waivers, Etc.
 
No express or implied waiver of any Event of Default by either party shall constitute a waiver of any other Event of Default and no exercise of any remedy hereunder by any party shall constitute a waiver of its right to exercise any other remedy hereunder. No modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and no consent by any party to a departure here-from shall be effective unless and until such shall be in writing and duly executed by both of the parties hereto. Without limitation on any of the foregoing, the failure to give a notice pursuant to Paragraph 4(a) or 4(b) hereof will not constitute a waiver of any right to do so at a later date.
 
18.
 
Use of Employee Plan Assets
 
If assets of an employee benefit plan subject to any provision of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (""ERISA"") are intended to be used by either party hereto (the ""Plan Party"") in a Transaction, the Plan Party shall so notify the other party prior to the Transaction. The Plan Party shall represent in writing to the other party that the Transaction does not constitute a prohibited transaction under ERISA or is otherwise exempt therefrom, and the other party may proceed in reliance thereon but shall not be required so to proceed.
(a)
  
Subject to the last sentence of subparagraph (a) of this Paragraph, any such Transaction shall proceed only if Seller furnishes or has furnished to Buyer its most recent available audited statement of its financial condition and its most recent subsequent unaudited statement of its financial condition.
(b)
  
 
By entering into a Transaction pursuant to this Paragraph, Seller shall be deemed (i) to represent to Buyer that since the date of Seller's latest such financial statements, there has been no material adverse change in Seller's financial condition which Seller has not disclosed to Buyer, and (ii) to agree to provide Buyer with future audited and unaudited statements of its financial condition as they are issued, so long as it is a Seller in any outstanding Transaction involving a Plan Party.
(c)
  
 
19.
 
Intent
 
The parties recognize that each Transaction is a ""repurchase agreement"" as that term is defined in Section 101 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of Securities subject to such Transaction or the term of such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable), and a ""securities contract"" as that term is defined in Section 741 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(a)
  
 
It is understood that either party's right to liquidate Securities delivered to it in connection with Transactions hereunder or to exercise any other remedies pursuant to Paragraph 11 hereof is a contractual right to liquidate such Transaction as described in Sections 555 and 559 of Title 11 of the United States Code, as amended.
(b)
  
 
The parties agree and acknowledge that if a party hereto is an ""insured depository institution,"" as such term is defined in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, as amended (""FDIA""), then each Transaction hereunder is a ""qualified financial contract,"" as that term is defined in FDIA and any rules, orders or policy statements thereunder (except insofar as the type of assets subject to such Transaction would render such definition inapplicable).
(c)
  
 
It is understood that this Agreement constitutes a ""netting contract"" as defined in and subject to Title IV of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (""FDICIA"") and each payment entitlement and payment obligation under any Transaction hereunder shall constitute a ""covered contractual payment entitlement"" or ""covered contractual payment obligation"", respectively, as defined in and subject to FDICIA (except insofar as one or both of the parties is not a ""financial institution"" as that term is defined in FDICIA).
(d)
  
 
20.
 
Disclosure Relating to Certain Federal Protections
 
The parties acknowledge that they have been advised that:
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") under Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (""1934 Act""), the Securities Investor Protection Corporation has
(a)
  
taken the position that the provisions of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (""SIPA"") do not protect the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder;
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a government securities broker or a government securities dealer registered with the SEC under Section 15C of the 1934 Act, SIPA will not provide protection to the other party with respect to any Transaction hereunder; and
(b)
  
 
in the case of Transactions in which one of the parties is a financial institution, funds held by the financial institution pursuant to a Transaction hereunder are not a deposit and therefore are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, as applicable.

The Guarantor shall not have the right to assign its rights hereunder or any interest herein without the prior written consent of the Counterparty.

expenses) as they are incurred in connection with the investigation of, preparation for or defense of any pending or threatened claim or any action or proceeding arising from any of the matters referred to in the preceding sentence, whether or not such Indemnified Party is a party and whether or not such claim, action or proceeding is initiated or brought by or on behalf of World Trade or Agilent or the relevant issuer or whether or not resulting in any liability.  Neither Agilent nor World Trade shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there shall be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Agilent and World Trade jointly or severally agree to indemnify the Indemnified Party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that for the purposes of this paragraph the relative benefits to World Trade and Agilent, on the one hand, and to Merrill Lynch, on the other hand, shall be deemed to be in the same proportion that the total value received or contemplated to be received by World Trade and/or Agilent in any transactions contemplated pursuant to this Agreement bears to the fees paid or to be paid to Merrill Lynch with respect to such transaction; , , that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall the Indemnified Parties be required to contribute in respect of a specific transaction an aggregate amount in excess of the fees actually paid in such transaction to Merrill Lynch.  The foregoing contribution agreement shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party may have at common law or otherwise.  No investigation or failure to investigate by any Indemnified Party shall impair the foregoing indemnification and contribution agreement or any other right an Indemnified Party may have.

Agilent and World Trade jointly and severally agree that, without Merrill Lynch's prior written consent, neither World Trade nor Agilent nor any of their affiliates or subsidiaries will settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action or proceeding in respect of which indemnification has been or could be sought under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement (whether or not Merrill Lynch or any other Indemnified Party is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or proceeding), unless such settlement, compromise or consent (a) includes an unconditional written release, in form and substance satisfactory to Merrill Lynch and each Indemnified Party, from all liability arising out
 
of such claim, action or proceeding and (b) does not include any statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party.
 
In the event that an Indemnified Party is requested or required to appear as a witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or against Agilent or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates in which such Indemnified Party is not named as a defendant, World Trade and Agilent agree to reimburse such Indemnified Party for all reasonable expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnified Party's appearing and preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without limitation, the fees and expenses of its legal counsel.

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 14, 2008  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported orders of $1.39 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2008, 6 percent above one year ago. Revenues during the quarter were $1.44 billion, 5 percent above last year. Third quarter GAAP net income was $169 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter GAAP net income was $185 million, or $0.45 per share.
 
Included in this quarter's GAAP income is $22 million of non-cash amortization charges. Excluding this item and $7 million of other net charges,
 
 
Agilent reported third quarter adjusted net income of $198 million, or $0.53 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $173 million, or $0.43 per share, one year ago.
(1)
 
""The power of Agilent's operating model was clearly evident during the quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Economic conditions were difficult in much of the developed world, and third quarter revenues came in at the low end of our expectations. But we were able to quickly adapt to the changing economic environment, and our adjusted net income came in just above the high end of our expectations.""
 
Third quarter adjusted net income of $0.53 per share was 23 percent above one year ago compared with a 5 percent increase in revenues. Subtracting $18 million of share-based compensation from operating results, third quarter adjusted net income of $0.57 per share compares with guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.
 
Organic revenue growth in the Americas was about 3 percent, and local currency revenues were about flat in Europe compared with last year. Growth in Asia Pacific, at about 2 percent, was less robust than in recent quarters due largely to weakness in Japan.
 
Segment trends were very similar to the first half, with Bio-Analytical revenues up 13 percent, or 10 percent excluding acquisitions, with robust growth in both life sciences and chemical analysis markets. Electronic Measurement revenues increased less than 1 percent, with steady growth in communications test markets largely offset by weakness in semiconductor-related markets.
 
 was a record 27 percent, three points above last year. Inventory Days-On-Hand improved by four days from one year ago, and Receivables Days Sales Outstanding improved by one day. Cash generated from operations during the quarter was $169 million. During the period, the company repurchased $250 million of its common stock and paid $41 million for acquisitions.
Third quarter Return on Invested Capital

Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Sullivan said the company's outlook remained cautious but relatively unchanged. ""We anticipate tough conditions in much of the developed world and slowing, though still robust, growth in developing Asian markets.""
 
Given these trends, Sullivan said the company expected fiscal fourth quarter revenues in the range of $1.52 billion to $1.58 billion, up 5 percent to 9 percent from last year. Fourth quarter adjusted net income, including share-based compensation, is expected to be in the range of $0.58 to $0.62 per share, 26 percent to 35 percent above one year ago, and unchanged from prior guidance.
(3)
 
For the fiscal first quarter of 2009, Sullivan emphasized that visibility was poor given volatile economic conditions, and that the company would continue to plan conservatively. Revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.50 billion, up 4 percent to 8 percent from one year earlier. First quarter adjusted net income per share is expected to be in the range of $0.40 to $0.44 per share, 11 percent to 22 percent above the prior year's comparable earnings.

Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement orders were up 19 percent during the third quarter from one year ago, the ninth consecutive double-digit advance, and up 15 percent excluding the impact of the Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions. Revenues of $566 million were up 13 percent from last year, and up 10 percent excluding the two acquisitions. Revenues were up double-digit percentages in both
 
Life Sciences and Chemical Analysis. Geographically, revenues were up 15 percent in the Americas, 5 percent in Europe, and 23 percent in Asia.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $247 million were up 18 percent from one year ago, and up 11 percent excluding acquisitions. Pharma and Biotech markets were up 14 percent, with modest growth in the Americas and Europe and a strong performance from Asia. Sales to the academic and government markets were 36 percent above one year ago, with particular strength in microarrays, which were up nearly 50 percent. Chemical Analysis revenues of $319 million were up 10 percent from last year, with weakness in semiconductor-related materials science markets tempering what otherwise would have been 13 percent growth in Chemical Analysis revenues. Demand from petrochemicals was very strong, up 24 percent, and food safety was 17 percent ahead of one year ago.
 
 dropped one point to 25 percent due to acquisition-related costs and increased invested capital.
Third quarter segment income from operations of $101 million was $19 million above last year on a $66 million increase in revenues. Adjusting for the impact of the Stratagene and Velocity11 acquisitions, the segment generated a $22 million improvement in income on a $48 million increase in revenues. Operating margins of 18 percent were improved about one point from last year due to an equivalent increase in gross margin. Segment Return On Invested Capital

Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Third quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $793 million were 2 percent below last year. Revenues of $878 million were up less than 1 percent, with the Americas flat, Europe up 15 percent and Asia down 5 percent from one year ago
 
because of weakness in Japan. General Purpose Test revenues were down 5 percent from last year because of a nearly 50 percent decline in the semiconductor-related parametric test business. Communications Test revenues were up 9 percent, with strength in R&D markets for LTE and broadband applications, and a continuing rebound in handset manufacturing test.
 
 to improve four points to 27 percent.
Third quarter segment income from operations of $135 million was up $19 million from last year on a $4 million increase in revenues. Gross margins were about unchanged from last year, but tight control of operating expenses produced an operating margin of 15 percent, two points above one year ago. Higher profitability and aggressive asset management enabled segment ROIC

These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, and unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2008. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
 
 
 Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(1)
 
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
 
 Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q408 and Q109 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $13 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

 came in at the high end of our guidance.""
""The world has clearly changed in the past three months,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""We are pleased to have performed well in a very dynamic and difficult economic environment.  Fourth quarter revenues came in below the low end of our expectations because of weaker than expected Electronic Measurement markets. But, we were able to adjust to rapidly changing conditions, and our adjusted net income

 of $0.62 per share was 34 percent above one year ago compared with a 2 percent increase in revenues.
Fourth quarter adjusted net income

Organic revenue growth in the Americas was about 4 percent, and local currency revenues were about flat in Asia due to continued weakness in Japan. In Europe, organic revenues were down about 5 percent from one year ago.
 
Electronic Measurement markets weakened throughout the quarter, with orders down 10 percent from one year ago and revenues off 3 percent. Semiconductor-related markets remained particularly weak. Bio-Analytical markets were more robust, with orders up 8 percent and revenues up 10 percent, and were particularly strong in Asia.
 
 was 31 percent, a new high and six points above last year. Despite the weakening environment, working capital ratios were stable compared with last year's record performance. Cash generated from operations during the quarter was $258 million. During the period, the company repurchased $251 million of its common stock and ended the fiscal year with net cash of $969 million.

Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Sullivan noted that the full impact of the global financial meltdown on the world economy was far from clear. ""Our planning is based on the assumption that an economic downturn in much of the world will continue through mid-2009, and that no geographies or markets will be entirely immune from its impact.""
 
 is expected to be in the range of $0.34 to $0.38 per share, down 6 percent to up 6 percent from one year ago.
Given these trends, Sullivan said the company expected fiscal first quarter revenues in the range of $1.34 billion to $1.39 billion, down 4 percent to flat compared with last year. First quarter adjusted net income

 to be roughly flat with 2008 results on revenues that are flat to down 5 percent from this year.
Looking further ahead, Sullivan emphasized the uncertainty in the outlook, but said the company expected 2009 adjusted earnings per share

""Regardless of the economic environment, we remain committed to creating value for our customers as the world's premier measurement company, and to demonstrating the flexibility and strength of Agilent's operating model throughout the economic cycle,"" he said. Sullivan noted that the company would provide more details about 2009 expectations at Agilent's annual analyst meeting scheduled for Dec. 9, 2008, in New York City.

On December 17, 2008, Agilent Technologies, Inc. filed a Current Report on Form 8-K disclosing the approval of a targeted restructuring program (the ""Original Restructuring Program"").  On February 17, 2009, Agilent announced to its employees a revised restructuring plan, which includes actions to (1) exit the inspection businesses in its Semiconductor and Board Test segment, including the automated optical inspection and automated X-ray inspection businesses and (2) restructure its global infrastructure organization, in response to the continuing deterioration of economic conditions (the ""Additional Actions"").  The actions under the Original Restructuring Program and the Additional Actions (together, the ""Restructuring Program"") are part of a series of actions being taken by Agilent in response to the current economic situation.
Agilent expects that the Additional Actions will further reduce its global workforce of regular employees by approximately 600 positions, bringing the total headcount reductions under the Restructuring Program to approximately 1,100 people.  The timing and scope of workforce reductions will vary by location based on local legal requirements.  We expect to complete most of these activities related to the Restructuring Program by July 31, 2009, with the remainder expected to be completed by October 31, 2009.
 
In connection with the Additional Actions, we expect to record pre-tax restructuring and other charges in the aggregate of approximately $40 million related to employee severance arrangements, approximately $22 million related to excess inventory charges and approximately $38 million related to other charges, including, but not limited to, costs related to existing lease agreements and contract termination costs (incremental to the Original Restructuring Program).  We expect that substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures.
 
In connection with the Restructuring Plan (including the amounts due to the Additional Actions), we now expect to record in the aggregate approximately $155 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related charges.  We expect that substantially all of these charges will result in cash expenditures.
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Item 2.05 contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements relate to our planned restructuring activities and include our current estimates of the scope, timing and cost of those activities. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the risk of additional costs and delays associated with compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws, the risk that a further decline in general economic conditions and the global credit and equity markets or unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses and demand for current and new products and technologies will require changes to the planned restructuring, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.  Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

Second quarter revenue and non-GAAP earnings expected to be roughly in line with first quarter results
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 17, 2009  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.17 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2009, 16 percent below one year ago.  First quarter GAAP net income was $64 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. Last year's first quarter GAAP net income was $120 million, or $0.31 per share.
During the first quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $56 million, and $12 million of non-cash amortization.  It also recognized $56 million of tax benefits, and had $4 million of other net gains.  Excluding these items, Agilent reported first quarter adjusted net income of $72 million, or $0.20 per share.  On a comparable basis, the company earned $136 million, or $0.36 per share, one year ago.
 
""In the first quarter, Agilent felt the full brunt of the severe, worldwide economic downturn,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Revenues were well below our earlier expectations, and down 16 percent from one year ago.  We moved quickly to minimize the impact of this unexpected weakness, and delivered operating results consistent with Agilent's operating model.  But, operating earnings per share of $0.20 were also well below our earlier expectations due to lower activity levels.""
 
Agilent's first quarter revenues were down $227 million from one year ago, while operating profits were down only $69 million due to aggressive actions taken by the company to reduce operating costs across all operations and functions.
 
Revenues were down across the globe, with the Americas off 10 percent, Europe off 21 percent, and Asia down 18 percent from one year ago.  By segment, Semiconductor and Board Test was the hardest hit, off 49 percent from last year, while Electronic Measurement was down 23 percent and Bio-Analytical Measurement revenues were off 1 percent.
 
First quarter Return on Invested Capital
(2)
 
fell to 11 percent compared to 19 percent one year ago because of lower earnings.  Net working capital was reduced by $68 million from last year, and cash generated from operations during the seasonally weak first quarter was $17 million  slightly ahead of last year's first quarter performance despite sharply lower earnings.  During the period, the company repurchased $125 million of its common stock and ended the quarter with net cash of $852 million.
Looking ahead, Sullivan noted that the current global downturn is likely to be the most severe seen in the past 70 years.  Said Sullivan, ""We don't know where, or when, this recession will bottom.  But, we will remain proactive in addressing the economic challenges we face, and we are committed to delivering  performance consistent with Agilent's operating model.""
 
""In December, we announced targeted operational restructuring with annualized savings of $65 million.  Additionally, Agilent will immediately shut two small board-inspection businesses and begin a restructuring of its global infrastructure operations.  We expect this program, when fully implemented, to reduce ongoing operating costs by $150 million.""  The company said the cost of this program is expected to be in the range of $100 million and would result in about 600 headcount reductions.
 
Addressing second quarter performance expectations, Sullivan said, ""Forecasting in the current environment is almost futile, as visibility is virtually nil.  Our current best guess is that second quarter revenues and operating earnings
(3)
, which are normally seasonally stronger, will be roughly in line with first quarter results.
 
""Regardless of the economic environment, our commitment is to remain cash flow positive, to keep employees focused on customers, products and technologies, and to create value for our customers as the world's premier measurement company.""
 
Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement's nearly three-year record of double-digit orders growth came to an end in the first quarter, with orders of $523 million down 2 percent from one year ago.

Revenue in the Americas was up 1 percent, while Asia was up 10 percent from one year ago, with particular strength continuing in China.  By product platform, Gas (GC) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) were both weaker, while both microarrays and Liquid Chromatography / Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) were up double digits from last year.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $238 million were down 1 percent from one year ago.  Spending by Pharma and Biotech customers was down 8 percent, with weakness in replacement business while consumables and services remained steady.  Sales to the academic and government markets continued strong, 20 percent above one year ago, with particular strength in microarrays and LC/MS systems.
 
Chemical Analysis revenues of $287 million were down 1 percent from last year.  Sustained strength in food safety, up 13 percent, and steady petrochemical, up 1 percent, was offset by weakness in environmental and forensics markets.  From a platform perspective, demand was weak for GCs and relatively strong for LC/MS systems.
 
First quarter segment income from operations of $101 million was $14 million above last year's results despite a $6 million decline in revenues.  Gross margins were up about 2 points from last year, while operating margins, at 19 percent, were nearly 3 points higher than one year ago. Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
improved 1 point to 25 percent.
Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
First quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $560 million were 28 percent below last year, while revenues of $596 million were off 23 percent from one year ago.  Market weakness was widespread, with both General Purpose and Communications Test down 23 percent.  Geographically, Europe was off 26 percent and Asia was down 29 percent, while revenue in the Americas was 15 percent below last year.  More generally, demand from large multinationals was particularly weak.
 
General Purpose Test revenues of $337 million were down 23 percent from last year.  Aerospace / defense was off 11 percent from last year, with relative strength in China and stability in the U.S. more than offset by weakness in Europe and Japan.  Other general purpose markets were off 30 percent from last year due to weakness in electronics and other manufacturing markets.  Communications Test revenue of $259 million was down 23 percent, and was marked by double-digit declines across all end markets.
 
First quarter segment income from operations of $7 million was down $70 million from last year on a $177 million decline in revenues, or a 40 percent decremental. Gross margins fell by 2 points from last year, while operating expenses were $49 million below last year.  Operating margins fell 9 points to 1 percent.  Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 16 points to 3 percent, driven by lower profitability and relatively flat invested capital.
Semiconductor and Board Test
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Agilent is exiting the Automated Optical Inspection and Automated X-ray Inspection product lines of the Semiconductor and Board Test segment because they will not be able to achieve results consistent with Agilent's operating model in the foreseeable future.  The company earlier this quarter announced a focused restructuring of this segment to address the severe decline in business conditions, which continued through the first quarter of 2009.
 
Segment orders of $32 million were down 66 percent from last year as customer capital spending in all markets and geographies remains frozen.  Revenues of $45 million were off 49 percent from one year ago.  Europe was weakest, down 68 percent, the Americas declined 46 percent, and Asia was off 39 percent from last year.
 
First quarter segment loss from operations of $13 million was down $16 million from last year on a $44 million decline in revenues, or a 36 percent decremental.  Gross margins fell 13 points due to the drop in volumes, while operating expenses declined by $12 million from last year.  Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 15 points to (12) percent.

This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the future demand for the Company's products and services, guidance for the fiscal second quarter, and our planned restructuring activities, including our current estimates of the scope, timing and cost of those activities. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies, the risk of additional costs and delays associated with compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws associated with our planned restructuring activities, the risk that a further decline in general economic conditions and the global credit and equity markets will require changes to the planned restructuring, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop
products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2008.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 5 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
 Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q209 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $14 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

(b)
  Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
(c)
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria. We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments. We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company. We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

On May 14, 2009, Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2009.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Restructuring actions on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-2010
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., May 14, 2009  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.09 billion for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2009, 25 percent below one year ago. Second quarter GAAP net loss was $101 million, or ($0.29) per diluted share. Last year's second quarter GAAP net income was $173 million, or $0.47 per share.
During the second quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $98 million, and $12 million of non-cash amortization.  It also recognized a quarter-to-date tax adjustment of $31 million, and had $4 million of other net charges. Excluding these items, Agilent reported second quarter adjusted net income of $44 million, or $0.13 per share.  On a comparable basis, the company earned $172 million, or $0.46 per share, one year ago.
 
""In the second quarter, Agilent continued to deal aggressively with the effects of the severe global economic downturn,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive officer. ""Total revenues of $1.09 billion were 25 percent below last year despite the relative outperformance of our Bio-Analytical Segment, which was off 6 percent.
 
""The global collapse of electronics production caused severe declines in our Electronic Measurement and Semiconductor & Board Test segments, where revenues were off by 33 percent and 63 percent, respectively, from one year ago.  As previously announced, we are moving very quickly to restructure these businesses to achieve double-digit profitability even at these severely depressed activity levels.""
 
Second quarter Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
fell to 8 percent compared to 24 percent one year ago because of lower earnings. Net working capital was reduced by $228 million from last year, and cash generated from operations during the second quarter was $137 million.  The company ended the quarter with net cash of $922 million.
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan noted that there are some tentative signs that the global downturn may be nearing a trough.  Said Sullivan, ""If these early signals of a bottoming in global electronics markets continue, we could anticipate a bottoming in our electronic measurement business in the next few months.  There are also some indications that bio-analytical markets could begin to benefit from the global stimulus packages by year-end.  Based on these indicators, we would expect full year fiscal 2009 revenues to be down roughly 25 percent from 2008.""
""Our restructuring of corporate infrastructure and the businesses is on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-FY2010.  Regardless of the economic environment, our commitment is to remain cash-flow positive, to keep employees focused on customers, products and technologies, and to deliver performance consistent with Agilent's operating model.""
 
Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Considering the very difficult macroeconomic environment, Bio-Analytical Measurement performed well in the second quarter.  Orders of $481 million were down 16 percent from one year earlier, while revenues of $498 million were off 6 percent from last year.  During the quarter, Chemical Analysis was down 6 percent while Life Sciences revenues were off 7 percent.
 
Geographically, weakness was most pronounced in Europe, which was off 16 percent from last year, while revenue in the Americas was off 10 percent.  Asia remained an area of strength, with Japan up 7 percent from last year and other Asia up 12 percent.  China was particularly robust, up 29 percent from one year ago.  By product platform, Gas (GC) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) were both weak, offsetting continued strength in GC / Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS), LC/MS and microarrays.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $241 million were down 7 percent in the second quarter from one year ago.  Spending by Pharma and Biotech customers was down 11 percent, with a lengthening of the replacement cycle in the current soft environment and funding pressures impacting smaller biotech firms.  Sales to the academic and government markets continued strong, 10 percent above one year ago, with robust demand in Mass Spec systems as well as for microarrays.
Chemical Analysis revenues of $257 million were down 6 percent from last year.  Food safety continued its strong momentum and was up 30 percent from one year ago, while weakness was seen across most industrial markets.  From a platform perspective, demand remained weak for GCs and relatively strong for GC/MS and LC/MS systems.
 
Second quarter segment income from operations of $89 million was $4 million above last year's results despite a $32 million decline in revenues. Gross margins were up 1  points from last year, while operating margins, at 18 percent, were two points above one year ago.  Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
improved 2 points to 24 percent.
 
Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Second quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $523 million were 39 percent below last year, while revenues of $558 million were off 33 percent from one year ago.  Market weakness was pervasive, with General Purpose revenues down 28 percent and Communications 39 percent below one year ago. Geographically, Europe declined 30 percent, Japan was off 43 percent, other Asia dropped 32 percent and the Americas was 31 percent below last year.
 
General Purpose revenues of $336 million were down 28 percent from last year.  Aerospace / defense showed relative strength, down 2 percent and with signs of stabilization of U.S. demand.  Other general purpose markets were off 41
percent from last year due to extreme weakness in electronics manufacturing and computer / semiconductor markets.  Communications revenues of $222 million were down 39 percent from one year ago.  Wireless R&D showed relative strength, down 17 percent from last year and up 15 percent sequentially.  Other communications markets were down well over 20 percent from one year ago.
 
Second quarter segment profit declined $126 million from last year to an operating loss of $6 million based on a $273 million decline in revenues.  Gross margins fell by 7 points from last year due to lower volume, while operating expenses were $74 million below last year.  Operating margins fell 15 points to (1) percent. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 29 points to (1) percent, driven by lower profitability and despite $87 million lower invested capital.
 
As announced previously, Agilent has begun a program to reduce the operating breakeven of the Electronic Measurement segment by $300 million.  The program, designed to achieve a 12 percent operating margin and 21 percent ROIC
(2)
 at an annual revenue of $2.3 billion, is on track to be completed by mid-FY2010.
 
Semiconductor & Board Test
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
The company earlier this quarter announced an additional restructuring of the Semiconductor & Board Test segment to address the severe decline in business conditions, which continued through the second quarter of 2009.
 
Segment orders of $22 million were down 75 percent from last year as customer capital spending in all markets and geographies remains frozen. Revenues of $35 million were off 63 percent from one year ago. All geographies and product lines were off more than 50 percent from one year ago.
Second quarter segment loss from operations of $16 million represents a deterioration of $24 million from last year's results on a $60 million decline in revenues.  Gross margins fell 25 points due to the drop in volume, while operating expenses declined by $15 million from last year. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 23 points to (15) percent.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as gains and losses from the sale of investments and disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

On August 17, 2009, Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2009.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Highlights:
 
                 
GAAP net loss of $19 million, or ($0.06) per share
                 
Non-GAAP earnings of $53 million, or $0.15 per share
(1)
                 
Positive operating cash flow of $41 million in quarter
                 
Revenue of $1.06 billion, down 27 percent from last year; orders of $1.07 billion, down 23 percent from one year ago
                 
Restructuring actions on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-2010
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Aug. 17, 2009  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.06 billion for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2009, 27 percent below one year ago. Third quarter GAAP net loss was $19 million, or ($0.06) per diluted share. Last year's third quarter GAAP net income was $169 million, or $0.45 per share.
 
During the third quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $81 million and $11 million of non-cash amortization.
It also recognized a tax benefit of $36 million and had $16 million of other net charges. Excluding these items, Agilent reported third quarter adjusted net income of $53 million, or $0.15 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $198 million, or $0.53 per share, one year ago.
 
""Given the extraordinarily difficult economic conditions around the world, Agilent performed well in our third quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive.  ""Our restructuring actions to lower Agilent's revenue breakeven by over half a billion dollars are on track.  Third quarter revenues of $1.06 billion were off 27 percent from one year ago but close to our expectations.  Uncharacteristically for a third quarter, orders of $1.07 billion exceeded revenues, and were off 23 percent from last year.  Compared with three months ago, we have more confidence that the quarter just ended will represent the cyclical low point for Agilent.""
 
Electronic Measurement revenues were down 36 percent, with continued weakness across all end markets and across all regions.  Orders were down a less severe 26 percent and were up sequentially from Q2.  Bio-analytical segment revenues were 8 percent below last year, with applied markets down 11 percent and life science off 5 percent.  Bio-analytical segment orders declined 14 percent but were also up sequentially.
 
During the quarter, Agilent announced it signed a definitive agreement to acquire Varian, Inc. for $1.5 billion.  Closing is subject to regulatory and Varian shareholder approval, as well as other customary conditions, and is expected by calendar year-end.
 
Third quarter Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 fell to 9 percent compared with 27 percent one year ago because of lower earnings.  The company generated $41 million of cash from operations during the seasonally weak third quarter and ended the quarter with net cash of $981 million.
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan said that market conditions are expected to remain difficult through fiscal year-end, while recent increases in quotation activity and order funnels suggest that a modest recovery could begin early in fiscal 2010.
""We expect our fourth quarter revenues to improve seasonally, and that the benefits of our restructuring program will become increasingly evident in our operating results.  Non-GAAP earnings
(3)
 are expected to be in the range of $0.20 to $0.25 per share.""
 
Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Bio-analytical segment orders of $493 million were down 14 percent from one year earlier, while revenues of $496 million were off 8 percent from last year. During the quarter, Chemical Analysis revenues were down 11 percent, with continued strength in food markets and weakness in all other applied markets.  Life Sciences revenues were off 5 percent from one year ago.
 
Geographically, weakness continued to be most pronounced in Europe, which was off 22 percent from last year, while revenue in the Americas was down 13 percent. Asia remained an area of strength, with Japan up 8 percent from last year and other Asia up 19 percent. China was particularly robust, up 48 percent from one year ago. By product platform, Gas (GC) and Liquid Chromatography (LC) both remained weak, while microarrays remained strong, up nearly 20 percent.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $234 million were down 5 percent in the third quarter from one year ago, with spending by Pharma and Biotech customers down 6 percent, and sales to the academic and government markets off 2 percent from
one year ago.  Interest has been particularly strong for the new 1290 Infinity LC introduced in July, while the microarray business saw strong adoption of SurePrint arrays for Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) applications.
 
Chemical Analysis revenues of $262 million were down 11 percent from last year. Food safety remained robust, with revenues up 14 percent from one year ago, while weakness was widespread in other applied markets. From a platform perspective, demand remained weak for GCs and relatively strong for LC/MS systems.
 
Third quarter segment income from operations of $91 million was $11 million below last year's results on a $44 million decline in revenues. Gross margins were off less than 1 point from last year, while operating margins, at 18 percent, were also down less than 1 point from one year ago. Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
declined 2 points to 25 percent.
 
Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Third quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $542 million were 26 percent below last year but, uncharacteristically, were up sequentially from Q2.  Reflecting earlier orders weakness, revenues of $524 million were 36 percent below one year ago. Market weakness continued in all markets and all geographies, with General Purpose revenues down 25 percent and Communications 48 percent below one year ago. Geographically, Europe declined 38 percent, Japan was off 43 percent, other Asia dropped 30 percent and the Americas were 36 percent below last year.
General Purpose revenues of $326 million were down 25 percent from last year. Aerospace / defense held up best, off 6 percent from one year ago. Other general purpose markets were off 34 percent from last year due to continued severe weakness in electronics manufacturing and computer / semiconductor markets. Communications revenues of $198 million were down 48 percent from one year ago, with extreme weakness virtually across the board.
 
Third quarter segment profit declined $124 million from last year to an operating loss of $1 million based on a $290 million decline in revenues. Gross margins fell by 4 points from last year due to lower volume, while operating expenses were $65 million below last year. Operating margins fell 15 points to breakeven. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 29 points to 0 percent, driven by lower profitability and despite $232 million lower invested capital.
 
As announced previously, Agilent is implementing a program to reduce the operating breakeven of the Electronic Measurement segment by $300 million. This program is on track to be completed by mid-FY2010.
 
Semiconductor & Board Test
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
While industry conditions in Semiconductor & Board Test remain severely depressed, the Segment showed some signs of coming off the bottom during the third quarter.  Orders of $36 million were down 56 percent from last year but up 60 percent sequentially. Revenues of $37 million were off 59 percent from one year ago but up modestly from the second quarter.
Third quarter segment loss from operations of $10 million represents a deterioration of $21 million from last year's results on a $53 million decline in revenues. Sequentially, income improved $5 million on a $1 million increase in revenue as restructuring actions began to gain traction.  Gross margins fell 18 points due to the drop in volume, while operating expenses declined by $13 million from last year. Segment ROIC
(2)
 fell 19 points to (9) percent.

Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q409 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization.  Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided.  Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $11 million per quarter.

Restructuring actions on track to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-2010
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov. 13, 2009  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.17 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter ended Oct. 31, 2009, 21 percent below one year ago. Fourth quarter GAAP net income was $25 million, or $0.07 per diluted share. Last year's fourth quarter GAAP net income was $231 million, or $0.64 per share.
 
During the fourth quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $60 million and $10 million of non-cash amortization. Excluding these items and $16 million of other net charges, Agilent reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $111 million, or $0.32 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $223 million, or $0.62 per share, one year ago.
""Agilent had a relatively strong finish to an extraordinarily difficult year,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive. ""Fourth quarter revenues of $1.17 billion were off 21 percent from one year ago but were above our expectations, and up 10 percent from the third quarter.  Fourth quarter orders of $1.27 billion were off only 11 percent from last year and up 19 percent sequentially.""
 
""Non-GAAP earnings of $0.32 per share were well above our expectations, demonstrating the leverage we're seeing from small improvements in volume.  Our restructuring actions to lower Agilent's revenue breakeven by over half a billion dollars contributed meaningfully to this quarter's results.""
 
Electronic Measurement revenues were down 29 percent, with some signs of a turnaround in general products but continued weakness in communications products. Orders were down a less severe 18 percent from one year ago and were up a stronger than seasonal 18 percent from Q3. Bio-analytical segment revenues were 9 percent below last year, with applied markets down 10 percent and life science off 7 percent. Bio-analytical segment orders were off only 1 percent from last year and were up 20 percent sequentially.
 
Fourth quarter Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
fell to 18 percent compared with 31 percent one year ago because of lower earnings. Inventory Days On Hand were off only six days from last year's record lows, while Receivables Days Sales Outstanding improved by one day to a new fourth quarter low.  The company generated $208 million of cash from operations during the fourth quarter.  It also raised $750 million in three- and six-year notes, and ended the quarter with net cash of $1,215 million.
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan said, ""While it seems clear that we are past the worst of the global downturn, the pace of recovery is expected to be slow and to vary considerably by market and geography.  Our r
estructuring actions to achieve $525 million of annualized savings by mid-2010 are on track and, i
n recognition of the progress we are making, we have restored full pay around the world effective Nov. 1.
""We expect our fiscal first quarter revenues to be roughly flat with one year ago, while our Non-GAAP earnings
(3)
 
are expected to be in the range of $0.28 - $0.32, improved by $0.08 - $0.12 per share compared to last year.""
 
During the quarter, Agilent continued to work with U.S. and EU regulatory authorities on its proposed acquisition of Varian, Inc. for $1.5 billion. At this point, closing is anticipated early in calendar 2010.
 
Segment Results
 
Bio-Analytical Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Bio-analytical segment orders of $590 million were down only 1 percent from one year earlier, and were up 20 percent sequentially from the third quarter.  Revenues of $544 million were off 9 percent from last year and up 10 percent sequentially. During the quarter, Chemical Analysis revenues were down 10 percent from last year, with continued strength in food markets and weakness in most other applied markets. Life Sciences revenues were off 7 percent from one year ago.
 
Geographically, weakness was most pronounced in the U.S. and Europe, which were off 12 percent and 11 percent, respectively, from one year ago. Asia was generally flat, with Japan up 2 percent and other Asia off 1 percent.  China
revenues were flat versus last year but only because of an extraordinary surge in volumes last year related to food safety issues; fourth quarter orders in China were 30 percent above one year ago.
 
Life Sciences revenues of $256 million were down 7 percent in the fourth quarter from one year ago, with spending by Pharma and Biotech customers down 8 percent, and sales to the academic and government markets off 4 percent from one year ago. There were some signs of thawing in the worldwide Pharma market, and interest for the new 1290 Infinity LC introduced in July has exceeded expectations.
 
Chemical Analysis revenues of $288 million were down 10 percent from last year. Food safety remained robust, with revenues up 19 percent from one year ago.  Consumables and services were stable compared with one year ago, while weakness remained widespread in other applied markets. From a platform perspective, demand remained weak for GCs and relatively strong for high-end LC/MS systems.
 
Fourth quarter segment income from operations of $109 million was $27 million below last year's results on a $50 million decline in revenues. Gross margins were off 1 point from last year, while operating margins, at 20 percent, were down 3 points from the prior year's record performance. Segment Return On Invested Capital
(2)
 
declined 5 points to 31 percent.
 
Electronic Measurement
($ millions except where noted)
 
Fourth quarter Electronic Measurement orders of $641 million were 18 percent below last year and were up a more than seasonal 18 percent sequentially from Q3. Reflecting earlier orders weakness, revenues of $582 million were 29 percent below one year ago.   General Purpose markets showed clear signs of bottoming while Communications remained very weak.  Geographically, Europe declined 31 percent, Japan was off 38 percent, other Asia dropped 24 percent and the Americas were 28 percent below last year.
 
General Purpose revenues of $373 million were down 17 percent from last year but were up 15 percent from Q3. Aerospace / defense held up best, unchanged compared to one year ago. Other general purpose markets were off 27 percent from last year due to continued weakness in electronics manufacturing and computer / semiconductor markets. Communications revenues of $209 million were down 43 percent from one year ago, with only investments in LTE, network monitoring, and China 3G infrastructure showing signs of stabilization.
 
Fourth quarter segment profit of $41 million was $95 million below last year on a $233 million decline in revenues  an impressive 41 percent decremental resulting from rapid actions to reduce structural costs in this severe downturn. Gross margins fell by less than 2 points from last year due to lower volume, while operating expenses were $50 million below last year. Operating margins fell 10 points to 7 percent. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell 22 points to 12 percent, driven by lower profitability and despite $209 million lower invested capital.
 
Semiconductor & Board Test
($ millions except where noted)
 
 
Results in the severely depressed Semiconductor & Board Test segment improved for the second consecutive quarter.  Fourth quarter orders of $43 million remain 25 percent below one year ago but were 22 percent ahead of Q3 and nearly double the pace 6 months ago.  Revenues of $41 million were off 43 percent from one year ago but up 10 percent from the third quarter.
Fourth quarter segment loss from operations of $1 million represents a deterioration of $1 million from last year's results on a $31 million decline in revenues. At this point, the segment has completed its restructuring program and exceeded the original cost reduction goals.  Compared to last year, gross margins were unchanged despite the severe drop in volume, while operating expenses declined by $12 million from last year. Segment ROIC
(2)
 
fell three points to (1) percent.

This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the future demand for the Company's products and services; revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2010; the planned acquisition of Varian, Inc. and our planned restructuring activities, including our current estimates of the scope, timing and cost of those activities. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals for the Varian acquisition, satisfaction of closing conditions precedent to the consummation of the Varian acquisition, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies, the risk of additional costs and delays associated with compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws associated with our planned restructuring activities, the risk that a further decline in general economic conditions and the global credit and equity markets will require changes to the planned restructuring, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 31, 2009. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
 
 
(1)
 
Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, business separation costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q110 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary adjusted net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current period presentation
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

Full fiscal year 2010 revenues expected to rise roughly 10 percent, and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.65 - $1.70 per share.
 
SANTA CLARA, Calif., Feb. 12, 2010  Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today reported revenues of $1.21 billion for the first fiscal quarter ended Jan. 31, 2010, 4 percent above one year ago. First quarter GAAP net income was $79 million, or $0.22 per diluted share. Last year's first quarter GAAP net income was $64 million, or $0.18 per share.
During the first quarter, Agilent had restructuring and asset impairment charges of $48 million and $10 million of non-cash amortization. Excluding these items and $2 million of other net charges, Agilent reported fourth quarter adjusted net income of $135 million, or $0.38 per share. On a comparable basis, the company earned $72 million, or $0.20 per share, one year ago.
 
""The economic momentum Agilent began to see late last year continued in our fiscal first quarter,"" said Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and chief executive. ""First quarter revenues of $1.21 billion were up sequentially for the second consecutive quarter, and were 4 percent above one year ago.""
 
First quarter Electronic Measurement revenues were down 2 percent from one year ago, but orders were up 8 percent, with solid demand from industrial, computer and semiconductor.  Chemical Analysis revenues were 13 percent above one year ago, while orders were up 12 percent.   Life Sciences revenues were 10 percent ahead of last year while orders were up 9 percent from one year ago.
 
""Non-GAAP earnings of $0.38 per share were well above our expectations,"" said Sullivan, ""demonstrating the power of Agilent's operating model as our markets begin to recover.  Our restructuring actions to lower Agilent's revenue breakeven by over half a billion dollars can also be clearly seen in this quarter's operating results.  Early in the new upturn, we are already reporting mid-cycle operating margins of 15 percent and a 21 percent Return On Invested Capital
(2)
.""
 
First quarter ROIC of 21 percent compared with 11 percent one year ago.  Inventory Days On Hand improved by 19 days to 93, while Receivables Days Sales Outstanding, at 47, improved by two days.  The company generated $30 million of cash from operations during the seasonally weak first quarter.  It ended the quarter with net cash of $1.20 billion.
 
Looking ahead, Sullivan said, ""It is still early in the new economic cycle to be confident of future prospects but our orders suggest that the momentum will
 
continue at a moderate pace, with broadening of the recovery across most markets and geographies as the year unfolds.
 
""We expect our fiscal second quarter revenues to be about 12 - 15 percent above last year, while non-GAAP earnings
(3)
 
are expected to be in the range of $0.38 - - $0.42 per share compared to $0.13 one year ago.  For the full fiscal year 2010, we now expect Agilent stand alone revenues to be up roughly 10 percent and non-GAAP earnings to be in the range of $1.65 - $1.70 per share.""
 
During the quarter, Agilent announced it had received conditional antitrust clearance from the European Commission (EC) for Agilent's proposed acquisition of Varian Inc.  The company is in the process of divesting certain assets in order to comply with the remedies required by the EC.  Clearance by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is still pending, although we do not expect the FTC to seek additional remedies in markets beyond those committed to for the European Commission.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the future demand for the Company's products and services; revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2010; the planned acquisition of Varian, Inc. and our planned restructuring activities, including our current estimates of the scope, timing and cost of those activities. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals for the Varian acquisition, satisfaction of closing conditions precedent to the consummation of the Varian acquisition, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies, the risk of additional costs and delays associated with compliance with U.S. and international labor and other laws associated with our planned restructuring activities, the risk that a further decline in general economic conditions and the global credit and equity markets will require changes to the planned restructuring, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin
 
pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2009. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

Adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share are non-GAAP measures. Each of these measures is defined to exclude primarily the impacts of restructuring and asset impairment charges, transformation initiatives, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between adjusted net income and GAAP net income is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 5 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
Adjusted net income per share as projected for Q210 and full fiscal year 2010 is a non-GAAP measure which excludes primarily the impacts of future restructuring and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $10 million per quarter.

We provide adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
 
Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor.  ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders.  Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.

On May 17, 2010, Agilent Technologies, Inc.
(the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the second fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2010.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Life Sciences revenues were 12 percent ahead of last year. Demand was solid from academia and government customers. Reductions in pharmaceutical R&D were offset by growth in developing countries, as well as biotech spending.
 
Second quarter Electronic Measurement revenues were up 18 percent from one year ago, rebounding to almost $700 million. Agilent's general purpose markets continued to strengthen, led by an overall improvement in the economy and demand in electronics and semiconductors.

Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS reconciliation is estimated based on our current information.

The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the future demand for the Company's products and services; and revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2010.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products and technologies, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from the restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles while it continues to implement cost reductions; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate Varian, Inc. and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2010. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Revenues, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses. A reconciliation between non-GAAP revenues, and GAAP revenues is set forth on page 9 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3)
 Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q410 and full fiscal year 2010 excludes primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $31 million per quarter.
 
(4)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(5)
 Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents and (3) investments  debt securities less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt, (2) long-term debt and (3)
senior notes. The reconciliation of Net Cash can be found on page 10 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income (loss) from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income (loss) from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
   Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income from operations of $191 million plus net interest expense after tax of $17 million for Q3'10, and $53 million plus net interest expense after tax of $13 million for Q3'09. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations.
(b)
   Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
(c)
   Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Revenue, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, is a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We excluded the effect of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures because the nature, size and number of these can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
 
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2) 
Revenues, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses. A reconciliation between non-GAAP revenues and GAAP revenues is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(3) 
Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q111 and full fiscal year 2011 excludes primarily the impacts of integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $28 million per quarter.
 
(4) 
Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(5) 
Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents and (3) investments  debt securities less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt, (2) long-term debt and (3) senior notes.

We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)      
Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income from operations of $228 million plus net interest expense after tax of $18 million for Q4'10, and $111 million plus net interest expense after tax of $13 million for Q4'09. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income from operations to GAAP income (loss) from operations.
(b)      
Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
(c)      
Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
Revenues, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We excluded the effect of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures because the nature, size and number of these can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

(the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended January 31, 2011.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.

This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.

Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary segment information is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
 Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income of $212 million plus net interest expense after tax of $15 million for Q1'11, and $135 million plus net interest expense after tax of $16 million for Q1'10. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.
 
(b)
 Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c)
 Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
Revenues, excluding the impact of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impacts of the Varian acquisition and the divestitures of our Network Systems and Hycor businesses.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We excluded the effect of the Varian acquisition and recent divestitures because the nature, size and number of these can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q311 and full fiscal year 2011 excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $29 million per quarter.
 
(3)
 Revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures that have closed within the past year. A reconciliation between non-GAAP revenues and GAAP revenues is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(4)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(5)
 Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents, (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents and (3) investments  debt securities less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt and (2) senior notes.

Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs, non-cash intangibles amortization as well as disposals of businesses net of their tax effects. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earning and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
(2) 
Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q411 and full fiscal year 2011 excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $29 million per quarter.
 
(3) 
Revenues, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, are a non-GAAP measure and are defined to exclude the fair value adjustment to acquisition related deferred revenue balances for the Varian acquisition and exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures that have closed within the past year. A reconciliation between non-GAAP revenues and GAAP revenues is set forth on page 8 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(4) 
Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income (loss) from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(5) 
Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents and (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt and (2) senior notes.

(a)
             
The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability.   For the three and nine months ended July 31, 2011, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17% that we believe to be indicative of on-going operations.
 
Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs, and the sale of our businesses. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, the acquisition of Varian, Inc., and the sale of our businesses.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of these tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary segment information is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a) 
Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income of $276 million plus net interest expense after tax of $14 million for Q3'11, and $191 million plus net interest expense after tax of $17 million for Q3'10. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.
 
(b) 
Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c) 
Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
Non-GAAP revenue is defined as revenue excluding the fair value adjustment of the deferred revenue balances related to the Varian acquisition. Organic Non-GAAP revenue is defined as Non- GAAP revenue excluding the impact of acquisitions that have closed within the past year.  Due to the close date of the Varian acquisition which occurred on May 15, 2010, we have also excluded the first two weeks of Q3 2011 revenue related to Varian in our revenue adjustment from acquisitions.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers. We excluded the effect of the Varian and other recent acquisitions because the nature, size and number of these can vary dramatically from period to period and between us and our peers, which we believe may obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.
 
The preliminary revenue information is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

(the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter ended October 31, 2011.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.

This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

(b)
 Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c)
 Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
 
Non-GAAP revenue is defined as revenue excluding the fair value adjustment of the deferred revenue balances related to the Varian acquisition.
 
Management believes that this measure provides useful information to investors by reflecting an additional way of viewing aspects of Agilent's operations that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measures, help our investors to better identify underlying growth trends in our business and facilitate easier comparisons of our revenue performance with prior and future periods and to our peers.
 
The preliminary revenue information is estimated based on our current information.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.

This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.

The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Forward-Looking Statements
 
This news release contains forward-looking statements as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to the safe harbors created therein. The forward-looking statements contained herein include, but are not limited to, information regarding Agilent's future revenues, earnings and profitability; the future demand for the Company's products and services; and revenue and non-GAAP earnings guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2012. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause Agilent's results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products, technologies, and services, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from integration and restructuring activities.
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate Varian, Inc. and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2011. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.
 
(1)
 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 4 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2)
 Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q2FY12 and full fiscal year 2012 excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $28 million per quarter.
(3)
 Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(4)
 Net Cash is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as (A) the sum of (1) cash and cash equivalents and (2) restricted cash and cash equivalents less (B) the sum of (1) short-term debt and (2) senior notes. The reconciliation of Net Cash can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

The preliminary balance sheet is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
The preliminary cash flow is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
(a)
 The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability.  For the three months ended January 31, 2012, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 17%  that we believe to be indicative of on-going operations.
 
Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.
 
(a)
 Return On Invested Capital is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 6 of these tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary segment information is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
ROIC calculation:(annualized current quarter segment return)/(average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of Segment Invested Capital)
 
(a)
 Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income of $244 million plus net interest expense after tax of $18 million for Q1'12, and $212 million plus net interest expense after tax of $15 million for Q1'11. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.
 
(b)
 Segment assets consist of inventory, accounts receivable, property plant and equipment, gross goodwill and other intangibles, deferred taxes and allocated corporate assets.
 
(c)
 Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures.  They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures.  It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
The preliminary reconciliation of ROIC is estimated based on our current information.
 
 
 
The preliminary reconciliation of net cash is estimated based on our current information.
 
Management believes this metric provides useful information to investors about the Company's overall liquidity and financial position.  Net Cash is a measure at a point in time and does not reflect the Company's future financial prospects or liquidity.

Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, unforeseen changes in the strength of our customers' businesses, unforeseen changes in the demand for current and new products, technologies, and services, and the risk that we are not able to realize the savings expected from integration and restructuring activities.
 
In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions
 
on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate Varian, Inc. and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended January 31, 2012. Forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs and assumptions of Agilent's management and on currently available information. Agilent undertakes no responsibility to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement.

Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. A reconciliation between non-GAAP earnings and GAAP net earnings is set forth on page 5 of the attached tables along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.
 
(2) 
Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q3FY12 and full fiscal year 2012 excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability. Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $24 million per quarter.
 
(3) 
Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as income from operations less other (income) expense and taxes, annualized, divided by the average of the two most recent quarter-end balances of assets less net current liabilities. The reconciliation of ROIC can be found on page 7 of the attached tables, along with additional information regarding the use of this non-GAAP measure.

(a)
        
The adjustment for taxes excludes tax benefits that management believes are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability.  For the six months ended April 30, 2012, management uses a non-GAAP effective tax rate of 16%  that we believe to be indicative of on-going operations.
 
Historical amounts are reclassified to conform with current period presentation.
 
We provide non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share amounts in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and our prospects for the future. These supplemental measures exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges and acquisition and integration costs. Some of the exclusions, such as impairments, may be beyond the control of management. Further, some may be less predictable than revenue derived from our core businesses (the day to day business of selling our products and services). These reasons provide the basis for management's belief that the measures are useful.
 
Our management uses non-GAAP measures to evaluate the performance of our core businesses, to estimate future core performance and to compensate employees. Since management finds this measure to be useful, we believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to seeing our GAAP results. This information facilitates our management's internal comparisons to our historical operating results as well as to the operating results of our competitors.
 
Our management recognizes that items such as amortization of intangibles and restructuring charges can have a material impact on our cash flows and/or our net income. Our GAAP financial statements including our statement of cash flows portray those effects. Although we believe it is useful for investors to see core performance free of special items, investors should understand that the excluded items are actual expenses that may impact the cash available to us for other uses. To gain a complete picture of all effects on the company's profit and loss from any and all events, management does (and investors should) rely upon the GAAP income statement. The non-GAAP numbers focus instead upon the core business of the company, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of the company's performance.
 
Readers are reminded that non-GAAP numbers are merely a supplement to, and not a replacement for, GAAP financial measures. They should be read in conjunction with the GAAP financial measures. It should be noted as well that our non-GAAP information may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.

Income from operations reflect the results of our reportable segments under Agilent's management reporting system which are not necessarily in conformity with GAAP financial measures. Income from operations of our reporting segments exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of intangibles, the impact of restructuring charges, acquisition and integration costs.
 
In general, recorded orders represent firm purchase commitments from our customers with established terms and conditions for products and services that will be delivered within six months.

Agilent return is equal to non-GAAP net income of $275 million plus net interest expense after tax of $18 million for Q2'12, and $261 million plus net interest expense after tax of $14 million for Q2'11. Please see ""Non-GAAP Net Income and Diluted EPS Reconciliations"" for a reconciliation of non-GAAP net income to GAAP net income.

Includes accounts payable, employee compensation and benefits, deferred revenue, certain other accrued liabilities and allocated corporate liabilities.
 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor. ROIC is a tool by which we track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Management uses ROIC as a performance measure for our businesses, and our senior managers' compensation is linked to ROIC improvements as well as other performance criteria.  We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.

On August 15, 2012, Agilent Technologies, Inc. (the ""Company"") issued its press release announcing financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2012.  A copy of this press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
 
We provide non-GAAP financial information in order to provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance and to enhance our investors' overall understanding of our core current financial performance and our prospects for the future.  We believe that our investors benefit from seeing our results ""through the eyes"" of management in addition to the GAAP presentation.  Management measures segment and enterprise performance using measures such as those that are disclosed in this release.  This information facilitates management's internal comparisons to the Company's historical operating results and comparisons to competitors' operating results.  Non-GAAP information allows for greater transparency to supplemental information used by management in its financial and operations decision making.  Historically, we have reported similar non-GAAP information to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our financial reporting.
 
This information is not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  It excludes items, such as restructuring and amortization, that may have a material effect on the Company's expenses and earnings per share calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Management monitors these items to ensure that expenses are in line with expectations and that our GAAP results are correctly stated but does not use them to measure the ongoing operating performance of the Company.  The non-GAAP information we provide may be different from the non-GAAP information provided by other companies.
 
Additional explanation of non-GAAP information is provided in Exhibit 99.1.

Bill Sullivan, Agilent president and CEO, said, ""Agilent's performance in the fiscal third quarter did not meet our revenue and EPS guidance. We have clearly entered an environment of much slower growth, resulting in deals taking longer to close and customers delaying their order deliveries.
 
""Despite the global environment, however, we delivered a strong operating margin performance that underscores Agilent's ability to proactively respond to rapidly changing market conditions.""
 
Electronic Measurement third-quarter revenues were down 1 percent over the prior year. Orders declined 4 percent from the same period last year. Growth in communications was driven by wireless manufacturing and was offset by weaker aerospace and defense and industrial demand.
 
Chemical Analysis revenues were flat with a year ago. Orders were down 7 percent. Food and forensics markets held steady, while petrochemical and energy were impacted by the global economy.
 
Life Sciences revenues grew 2 percent over last year, while orders declined 2 percent year over year.  Growth in the pharma market was offset by a decline in academic and government.
 
Diagnostics and Genomics, which includes the recent Dako acquisition, had revenues of $106 million.
 
Agilent generated $240 million of cash from operations in the quarter. Third-quarter ROIC was 18 percent

Fiscal fourth-quarter 2012 revenues are expected to be in the range of $1.76 billion to $1.78 billion. Fiscal fourth-quarter non-GAAP earnings are expected to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.82 per share

In addition, other risks that Agilent faces in running its operations include the ability to execute successfully through business cycles; the ability to meet and achieve the benefits of its cost-reduction goals and otherwise successfully adapt its cost structures to continuing changes in business conditions; ongoing competitive, pricing and gross-margin pressures; the risk that our cost-cutting initiatives will impair our ability to develop products and remain competitive and to operate effectively; the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and global economic conditions on our operations, our markets and our ability to conduct business; the ability to improve asset performance to adapt to changes in demand; the ability of our supply chain to adapt to changes in demand; the ability to successfully introduce new products at the right time, price and mix; the ability of Agilent to successfully integrate recent acquisitions and other risks detailed in Agilent's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended April 30, 2012.

 Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per share are defined to exclude primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, acquisition fair value adjustments, transformation initiatives and restructuring costs and non-cash intangibles amortization. We also exclude any tax benefits that are not directly related to ongoing operations and which are either isolated or cannot be expected to occur again with any regularity or predictability.

 Non-GAAP earnings per share as projected for Q4FY12 and full fiscal year 2012 excludes primarily the impacts of acquisition and integration costs, future restructuring, and asset impairment charges and non-cash intangibles amortization.

Most of these excluded amounts pertain to events that have not yet occurred and are not currently possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Therefore, no reconciliation to GAAP amounts has been provided. Future amortization of intangibles is expected to be approximately $42 million per quarter.

We believe that ROIC provides our management with a means to analyze and improve their business, measuring segment profitability in relation to net asset investments.  We acknowledge that ROIC may not be calculated the same way by every company.  When we complete major acquisitions, we may adjust invested capital for the relevant segment in the quarter when the acquisition occurred.  We compensate for this limitation by monitoring and providing to the reader a full GAAP income statement and balance sheet.
