## Note to Viewer
* The results viewed in ```comboplot.png or comboplot.jpg``` are obtained by running our model workflow on actual data from the San Diego County. 
* Due to security concerns we are unable to provide access to this data, so we hope that the combination plots generated here will suffice as evidence
on this GitHub repo. We are happy to share our report on request where have have all the images generated.
* As always, the code that generated this analysis on the comet infrastructure is provided under ```src/analysis.py```, which is open to view.
