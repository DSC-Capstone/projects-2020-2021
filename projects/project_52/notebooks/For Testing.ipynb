Lowest third involves a bit of good footwork, then an easy scramble for the middle third, then the top bit is probably the crux and trickier than it looks.    The base is on the disabled trail to Glacier Point so be very careful not to obstruct it - however the trail is very wide at that point - easily wide enough for buggies with room left over for ropes and a belayer. It may be worth checking with the rangers in the gift shop that it's OK to do this, though a ranger was supportive of our efforts!    Suspect there are other routes up the same crag which could be done with a bit of tweaking of the same anchor.\",\n",

Rope up at the lodge-pole and follow a trough up and right to a belay bolt. Traverse right (5.8), then climb up and right to a very brush ledge. Continue up and right for about 200 feet, then traverse right 30 feet and climb straight up past loose flakes to a ledge. Proceed upward over more flakes and a few small overhangs for 300 feet to ledge on lower angle rock. And easy pitch ends at the summit slabs.     (modern beta from mtnyoung on supertopo)   Pitch 1: (5.6) Look for three pine trees grouped close to the base of The West Face of Mt. Starr King. Begin at the north-most of these trees (this north-most tree\\x92s trunk forks partway up.) Follow a shallow, left facing corner/trough about 100 feet to an 18 inch wide roof (which is heavily marked by yellow lichen.) Good protection under the roof is followed by 25 feet of unprotected 5.6 slab, up and slightly left, ending at a two bolt belay on a lower angle section of face. (This pitch might be as long as 150 feet, depending on where a party ropes up.)    Pitch 2: (5.8) Traverse straight right for 25 feet to a right facing corner/flake (5.8). Go up and right along, and then over this. Continue toward a large bush which is on top of a thin ledge. Pass below the bush, moving onto the ledge just to its right. Belay 20 feet further up and right. (About 160 feet)    Pitch 3: (5.6) Unprotected 5.6 leads up and right 25 feet to the base of a prominent left facing corner. This \\x93spreads out\\x94 to become multiple corners higher. Belay not far above where the corners spread out. (140 feet)    Pitch 4: (5.8) Traverse left 30 feet across the tops of flakes and ledges to a single bolt. Three more well spaced bolts protect climbing straight up on a beautiful, golden slab to a point directly under a wide flake/roof. From the fourth bolt, move left five feet to a right facing corner (at a point where that right facing corner meets the roof.) Fun moves lead over the roof, then up and left 15 feet, to an excellent belay ledge. (150 feet)    Pitch 5: (5.8) Follow right facing corners upward, being careful to trend to the right, even though, in some places, leftward movement appears easier. Look for the best, most solid, crack system in which to belay. (170 feet, plus or minus)    Pitch 6: (5.5) Climb right and up a little, staying below blank and dirty sections of rock and roofs. After moving right, around a corner/roof, an up-and-left crack continues 50 feet; it starts at hand size and narrows to finger size. Belay on top of flakes above and right of the end of this crack. (170 feet)    Pitch 7: (5.0) Eighty more feet of easy flakes and face leads to the end of the climbing. Two hundred fifty feet more of class 3 and class 2 lead to the summit.',\n",

A hand size optional piece in the older guide and small optional pro suggested in the Supertopo guide is only recommended if you like carrying extra weight. You could place a hand size piece before the anchor that might hold body weight but would send rock down on your belayer as it ripped out in the event of a fall. You might also get a smaller piece to the left that could hold a fall but you would be blocking what I felt was a crucial undercling hold.

First pitch - good pro & moves to sloping ledge - 195' 5.7   2nd & 3rd pitches As per J. Albers (from comments)   The first pitch belay is actually in a scoop about 30 feet below the bolts you mentioned, though using the bolts is fine as long as nobody is using them for the face climb they are there for.   The second pitch continues up the crack past a bulge (bring a 4 inch piece for the bulge) and up the nice hand crack to a another scoop to belay...maybe 120-130 feet from the bolts.   Third pitch continues until the crack ends and you are on 4th class, belay where you can. You can then climb out on 4th class from this belay, though many will want a belay for the last bit of 4th class to the top of the dome (it is exposed). Enjoyable climb.   Cheers.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This is probably one of the best 5.12s in Tuolumne.  The crux 12c third pitch is CLASSIC sporty sport climbing with a very exciting and powerful crux on immaculate golden overhanging knobs. The position is exhilarating.   There is potential for big but clean air potential at the crux!  With no topo or route description for this climb, I pieced together some beta from Katie Lambert, but I'm  not sure if I climbed the first and final pitch correctly.  Really though, the middle two pitches are what you come for.  Be prepared for some serious runouts on easier sections, especially on pitch one and four.  Go for the victory whip from the top of the last pitch and break both your legs.    Pitch One:  5.10,  Look for the obvious bolted arete, and start to the left of this.  I think you can do some runout 5.10 at the start but I just headed up the obvious ramp to the right eventually reaching a single bolt and then a committing/dangerous  but surprising secure 5.10  knob crux.  Wander up knobs heading towards a ledge at the base of the obvious gold arete, and a 2 bolt anchor.  It would be possible to start on Sunshine which might offer a more classic first pitch, or for hard-person points Anatolio.     Pitch Two: 5.11d,  Place one cam in the corner, then head out to arete, and a uncharacteristically well protected 11d arete pitch on golden knobs, with the crux at the end getting to the ledge with 2 bolts. Excellent climbing.  Lament the fact that the crux pitch is not bolted this way.    Pitch Three:  The Money Pitch! Head out left off the anchor and clip two bolts and then get ready to boulder.  There is no clipping up this one.  This is really one of the best pitches I've done in Tuolumne. I couldn't figure out the sustained boulder problem on lead and figured out a way to toprope it before I red-pointed it... still quite thrilling as a head point.   Straight up off the anchor is the crux pitch of Sunshine 5.10d R.  From the anchor of this amazing pitch you can pendulum over to the Acapulco anchor to work the crux.  Did I mention this pitch is AMAZING!    Pitch Four: and maybe Five.  Choose your own adventure!  Head up slightly left off the anchor to a single bolt.  Look up into a sea of knobs with absolutely no idea where the first ascent went.  No matter where you go, it's going to be a run out affair.  When Sean Leary was still alive Katie asked him where he went on this pitch, but he couldn't remember.  My solution was to climb straight up off the bolt and then eventually trend up and right onto Sunshine.  I belayed at a two bolt anchor on sunshine about 60 feet below the top and then finished on the unprotected 5.7+ pitch.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Totally Awesome! Well the first two pitches are great! If I were to do the route again I would skip the third (which is Sunshine and quite exciting/scary), the fourth (sort of contrived feeling) and fifth pitches and link into the third (looks RAD!) and fourth pitches of Acapulco Gold.    --------------------------------------------------    P1. A very cool pitch of liebacking, knob pulling and mantling. Unless we both missed a bolt at the crux, it would be a bad fall if you blow the hard move at the top of the shallow left facing corner at the start (3rd bolt). Otherwise the pro is super bolted to two bolt chained anchor. (11a/b and fun)      P2. Up and left to the blunt arete of the beautiful gold plaque of smooth knobs. Halfway up the line of bolts, traverse right through a crux section (10+) and onto the slab under the big roof...Cool! This looks RAD!! Out the right side of the roof's apex is a traversing seam above a smooth face. A red Camalot extended with two runners fits well and deep in one of the slots low under the roof. I placed a red Alien in the handjam size slot at the beginning of the traverse, which allowed me to still lean off the jam and stretch up to the good undercling and place a bomber green Alien (green Camalot will then fit in the handjam, too). Prepare to get a little cramped-up on the undercling and cross-through moves out right. A brilliant sequence past the green Alien hits a double-handed sloper and shitty feet. If you can hold on, there are a couple options for gear. I placed a red Alien in an undercling (yellow Alien maybe in another slot or possibly a gold Camalot, big nut or Hex in the vertical crack in front of you). If you can't hold on to place a piece, its a big whipper onto the green Alien and maybe the slab. If your belayer is on it, it should be a clean fall (I tested this fall theory on my first go). Once you get to the lip/end of the roof, clip a fixed nut (if its there) with a doubled runner and power up the sequential corner all the way to the next roof. Ever so gingerly stem hard out right where a yellow or red Alien (better) fits. Yikes!! Another couple moves takes you to a bolted anchor with big quick-links. To protect the follower, I clipped the first bolt of Acapulco Gold's second pitch with a runner. (12b/c and amazing)     P3. Sunshine for 30 feet...Funky and run out to a good Lost Arrow (9 R). Weird knobs lead toward the roof (10- R. Load up the flake and make a crazy traverse (5.7 X) left across these wild tiered ledges to knobs and finally a bolted anchor w/o chain or links.       P4-5. Connect the dots of hard to see bolts that mostly follow cleaner gold knobs left of big, loose flakes. Just to the right of where Gram traverse finishes. (10- R with some fun knob sections)\",\n",

All anchors are bolted belays. The Crux is one move of 10.C face climbing that can be aided past if necessary. The route takes the path of most resistance up easier terrain. It is possible to link the first two pitches with a 70m rope. The final fourth pitch has the crux.

       "  'description': \"This is the obvious finish to OZ, but the FA team didn't climb it until a year later.  Some have said that the rock is sketchy on this climb, but overall it is quite good and this shouldn't scare anyone away.  The climbing on Gram is physical whereas the climbing on OZ is more technical -- a nice contrast and finish to the route.    After finishing the third pitch of OZ, continue as follows:    P4:  Climb up off the belay through some very powerful laybacks and underclings to a stance.  The climbing eases here until a bolted belay is reached below some hanging blocks.  5.10d.    P5:  Runner your gear very well and still expect to deal with rope drag.  Continue traversing under the roof with a few cruxy downclimbing sections of 5.10c or so.  One can belay off of bad gear or at an uncomfortable stance, but it is perhaps better to turn the roof at it's end and continue to the top.  Keep in mind this involves climbing a long passage of 5.5 knobs without much gear.  An awesome, exposed conclusion to the climb.  5.10c.\",\n",

Its pitches forge their way upwards to a striking right-facing dihedral and involve much interesting climbing.  I usually pronounce it \"ounce\" but sometimes I slip and say \"Oz.\"  When I\\'m feeling posh I say \"oh zee.\"    P1:  Begin at a little flake system well right of the huge dihedral above.  This flake system intersects a low roof.  Some tricky small gear protects this pretty well and gains a long left-angling flake/crack.  Follow this to its apex and belay.  5.10a.    P2:  Perform a tricky move up off the belay, then step left and climb past three bolts and a difficult hand traverse on slopers (crux).  This reaches a rest stance.  There is one more difficult face passage past a few more bolts before the climbing eases.  Climb up cracks and ledges to a belay on a sloping ramp that leads directly into the long corner.  A long pitch, 5.10d.    P3:  Climb the awesome, overhanging thin hands corner.  This pitch is soft for 10c and has many rest stances.  It is steep and amazing however.  Belay below the huge roof that caps Drug Dome.    P4:  Climb out left past a few bolts, around the arete, then up easy terrain to a belay below the summit.  5.9.

       "  'description': 'When put up in the mid 70\\'s this was your typical Tuolumne hard man horror show with single, 1/4\" bolt belays, 1-2 pieces of protection per pitch, etc. Nowadays with other routes in the area and rebolting the route has been tamed a bit, but it is still an exciting adventure.  My description is of the line of the original first ascent from a topo drawn by the first ascent party. Variations, most notably of the first and second pitches, exist.  Pitch 1 - start in a small right facing corner/ramp which leads up and left to a ledge. Once you gain the ledge, climb more or less straight up the face on knobs past one bolt to a two-bolt anchor(5.9).  Pitch 2 - climb up a small right facing corner/crack to a roof. \\xa0A 5.10a move right under the roof(hard to protect for the second) leads for about 20-25 feet right until a break allows one to climb over the roof(5.8). Proceed up to a belay with two bolts with rings. \\xa0Note: this isn\\'t actually the 2nd pitch belay on the original route. \\xa0It appears to be a belay from an unfinished route right of Sunshine, but the double bolts are not only convenient, but the actual 2nd pitch belay, below the 5.10a mantle with a bolt on the slab below is still a single bolt. \\xa0Climber\\'s choice!  Pitch 3 - head up and left to a bolt on a 20 degree slab below a small, double roof(original 2nd pitch belay). Do a double mantle over the roof(5.10a) with a fixed pin then proceed up and left to a belay at a large flake with two bolts.  Pitch 4 - the crux pitch(5.10d). Climb up a steep face past a fixed pin to a small roof. Surmount the roof and belay at a small ledge on the left with two bolts and rings.  Pitch 5 - move right and get pro in a small crack then go up and a bit left on knobs(5.9) to a two bolt belay with rings near a large, peach-sized knob.  Pitch 6 - continue climbing to the top. No protection to speak of, but only 5.7.  Sometime in the late 1970\\'s or 1980\\'s a 2-pitch variation to the original two pitches of Sunshine was climbed. It joins the original route at the 5.10 mantle with a bolt on a 20 degree sloping ledge. This is the 6th bolt on the second pitch of the variation. \\xa0Rather than belay at this single bolt the variation continues up to the anchors on top of the original 3rd pitch.  The variation begins about 30-50\\' right of the original start, just left of the obvious arete of the climb Push It. \\xa0It shares the same start as the route Roof Rat. \\xa0The description below is from John Scott(AKA Donner Summit).  \\xa0P1 40m Head up the obvious corner and step left onto the face below a pin. You can sling a knob to protect the move to the pin. Work left and up the face/corner with plenty of gear options. Step left around the corner just above a new anchor with mussy hooks. Sling a knob and continue to the obvious belay ledge and anchor. There are no bolts on this pitch.(5.9) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0P2 25m An offset protects the move to the 1st bolt. The mantle above the 1st bolt has a broken hold. Maybe a little harder now. After the 2nd bolt go left not up. You can sling a knob to protect the move at the end of the left traverse. Pull up and clip 3rd bolt. Continue with bolts and gear. After the 5th bolt go straight up and right on knobs. The bolt you see on the arete to the left is for Acapulco. The 6th bolt is shown as a 2 bolt anchor in the ‘06 Falcon guide but it’s now a single bolt. Don\\'t belay here. Pull up and place an offset in the roof before climbing up and right to clip a pin. Continue up to the roof and good gear. Exit left to the 2 bolt ASCA anchor.(5.10++)',\n",

       "  'description': 'This route climbs unique, ledgey features for three long pitches.  It is recommended that you go uphill a bit and scope out the two, small, right-facing dihedrals that are part of the first pitch.  Also, it is helpful to spot the V-shaped groove with a lone pine tree at it\\'s top which marks the end of the last pitch.    Pitch 1 - start about 50 feet right of Euro Trash and follow big, easy ledges up and right to a small right-facing dihedral.  Place pro and climb to the top of the dihedral.  Climb past two closely-spaced bolts(5.6) then up and slightly left for about 30-40\\' before traversing straight right back to another small right-facing dihedral and belay(#.5 Camalot, #1 Camalot, small stopper).    Pitch 2 - climb up to a bolt then go a bit right(5.7) and up to a big ledge.  The pitch goes more or less straight up, but you will need to zig zag back and forth to link up small ledge systems to get pro and keep the grade moderate. You will find a second bolt about 150\\' up.  From there traverse up and right and belay at a small crack system/ledge(#3 Camalot, 1/2\" cam, small stopper).    Pitch 3 - climb up and left on small ledges for 30\\' to a bolt.  Head up right then left to a second bolt.  Now, head up and right to a third bolt.  Climb up right(5.8) and then left into a groove. Continue up the groove for about 100\\' to the top.    The last pitch of this climb provides a nice, moderate finish to Euro Trash.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is a one-star slab climb on the right end of the Pennyroyal Arches. It climbs up the blank low-angle face to the left of the White Slab route (a 5.4 up the prominent left facing arching corner). The few difficult sections on the climb are fairly well protected, but expect runouts on 5.6 and easier terrain.    Pitch 1 heads straight up the low angle slab to a high first bolt. A horizontal crack provides more pro (either .5-.75\" or a 3\" cam works good) and then a second bolt protects the steeper 5.7/5.8 terrain before the anchor.    Pitch 2 has the crux right off the anchor but it felt a little light for 5.9. After smearing up and left to the first bolt the angle lessens and the rest of the pitch is a cruise. This pitch is supposed to have 3 bolts but I must have missed one. In any case there\\'s good natural gear on the upper half of the pitch and then a 5.6 runout to the anchor.    Pitch 3 climbs straight up off the belay past one bolt and then more runout easy friction to the big ledge.    Rappel the route with 2 ropes. It\\'s too bad the anchors are not in different locations because this climb would be better if you could do it in 2 long pitches and then descend with 2 long rappels.',\n",

This pitch would be classic no matter where it would be.  Originally rated 5.11d, it has since been down-rated to as low as 5.11b, but although the crux is brief, it is probably solid 5.11.      Most climb only through the second pitch and then rap with double ropes.      P1: Begin about 100\\' right of the obvious crack system of Phobos at a section of friable rock protected by a new bolt.  This short pitch was changed significantly in recent rockfall, but is still climbable at 5.10c.  Climb up to the first bolt (a small cam helps), then reach left and crank through the roof on large, flexing holds -- be very careful about what you pull on here!  Continue up a short, ugly hand crack to a nice ledge below the second pitch.  Belay from some fixed slings and possibly a #3 Camalot.    P2: Step up onto the face above and ascend it past a bolt to a stance.  Have a few medium wires or finger-size cams ready, and then climb up the finger crack (crux) to an obvious sharp horizontal \"rest\" jug.  Continue up the beautiful thin-hands crack to a final wide section (#3 Camalot) to a bolted anchor.

       "  'description': \"The counterpart to Phobos, and the other namesake climb of this cliff, Deimos is an excellent steep climb with a lot of hands/fists/OW crack.  It has a bit of a reputation as being hard, burly, and with less than perfect protection.  I found none of these to be particularly true.  The climb is truly a bit atypical for Tuolumne, being more reminiscent of Valley crack climbs with lots of wideness and flares.  But after the first 30 feet, the rock is excellent, there is pro wherever you want it, and the offwidth is pretty tame and easily stemmed or face-climbed around.  Phobos is maybe a slightly better climb (mostly just because of the awesome handcracks), but Deimos is still well worth climbing.    Pitch 1 (5.9, 60 feet): Belay on top of a massive boulder at the base of some stacked blocks leading up to the prominent V-slot roof.  Climb the blocks on good holds to reach the chimney, being careful of loose rock.  Stem and chimney up through the slot to a single tricky move getting up and into the crack above (crux).  Belay at a bad sloping stance shortly after the chimney, or continue higher to a better belay or to link pitches 1 and 2.    Pitch 2 (5.9, 120 feet): This pitch links fairly easily with Pitch 1 if you sling your pro carefully around the roofs.  Climb the slanting ramp/flare, using the wide-hands and offwidth crack in the back.  Arriving underneath the roof, you will find a slung block.  I think this spot would make a far more comfortable belay for Pitch 1 if you don't want to link the first two pitches.  Pass the roof on the left at 5.9 with interesting stems and jams, or undercling out the right at 5.10b.  Ascend the cracks above to an easy chimney, and step left to a good ledge for the belay.    Pitch 3 (5.9, 60 feet): Traverse left across the ledge, then climb the obvious large flakes to the summit, past a single bolt-protected 5.9 face move.  Belay from summit boulders.\",\n",

When the crack runs out, move right across the face on small foot holds until you reach the final dihedral for the final 15 feet to the top.  There is one big tree about 10 feet back that can be used as an anchor.  It's probably best to not use the small tree near the edge.\",\n",

Be very confident running it out on slabs -- the crux fourth pitch has the potential for 60-80' falls on 5.8 terrain in two different places, and a 30' fall on 5.9 ground.  The other pitches are easier, but still very sparsely protected.    P1: Climb a long gradually steepening slab to a bolted anchor at a stance on the dike.  This stance is roughly where two dikes intersect to form a cross.  5.4.    P2: Continue up the dike past a bolt and step left to another dike.  Follow this up to a bolted anchor on a big ledge.  5.6.    P3: Follow the dike up past three bolts to another bolted anchor.  5.7.    P4: Continue upwards past a pair of bolts (old anchor) and then run it out on 5.8 terrain up to a steep bulge.  Pull this bulge on good holds and continue relatively straight up to a thank-god bolt.  This bolt is hard to spot -- it's pretty much straight up, perhaps slightly to the right of the last belay, but don't stray too far in that direction.  After clipping this bolt there is a stretch of 5.9 (crux) climbing through some gold polish before finally reaching a bolted anchor.    P5: An easy pitch up to a bolted belay below the final headwall.  This can be breached via a wide crack, but most parties rap from here with double ropes (follow the Needle Spoon route on the descent).\",\n",

The climbing is fairly varied. The first pitch, which is the most interesting, starts at a two bolt anchor just where the angle steepens and ascends a short slightly steep section of knobs (2 bolts with old leeper-style hangers), crosses glacier polish (2 bolts) to a miniature roof. Step over the roof (1 bolt) and pass a small tree growing in a solution pocket (Zee Tree). The pitch originally ended at the tree, but to reduce impact on the fragile tree, the route now passes the tree on the right and ascends (5 bolts) to a comfortable stance and a two bolt anchor. This pitch is a full 165 feet.    The angle slackens above and the climbing eases as well. The second pitch is easy (5.5?) face climbing past 3 bolts to a another two bolt anchor. The final pitch is also easy face climbing , though interesting as the angle varies. It heads up and right past 2 bolts, then straight up and ends in a left facing book. This belay requires gear, medium nuts to medium friends.    To exit, climb up the left facing book and belay near the base of the crack pitch on the Dike Route. Either climb this crack (pro to #4 friend) and rappel the east end of Pywiak, or walk off to the west (not recommended).   :     The route was put up in good style. A mix of eighteen 5/16 and 3/8 inch bolts were placed by hand, on lead, from the ground up, though not in a continuous push. Two others were \"filled in\" while seconding after leading though originally, to eliminate uncharacteristic runout sections.',\n",

The first pitch of this route is covered in the 2nd edtion of the SuperTopo Tuolumne book; however, the climb continues on for two more pitches. While there is nothing on this route that qualifies as 'R', there is a fair bit of 5.7/5.8 climbing 10-15 feet above bolts and further distance on easier climbing.    Pitch one: Friction up past three bolts to a small, left angling ledge. Traverse the ledge and then climb up past two bolts. Continue upwards to a roof and a gear placement. Pull over the small roof and continue past one more bolt to a two bolt anchor (5.8; 160 feet).    Pitch two: Friction and smedge 12-15 feet up from the belay (5.7/5.8) to the first bolt. Continue past several more bolts to a small circular flake region that takes gear. Then continue up and gradually left, past several more well spaced bolts to a large right facing corner. Gear is available here and climbing to the top of the short corner gains a nice ledge and a two bolt anchor (5.9; 120 feet).    Pitch three: Climb up and right 15 feet from the belay to the first bolt. Clip two more bolts as you surmount a small roof and continue knob climbing to a right trending (dirty) ramp. Follow the ramp up and right (cams) to a clean face and a bolt. Climb up and left past several more bolts and mantle (5.8) onto a ledge at the top of Razor Back with a two bolt anchor (5.8; 170 feet).\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Flash of the Blade climbs fantastic knobs and edges up the center of Razor Back. The climbing is runout in sections, but there is protection whenever you really want it. Both my partners and I agreed that this was a really excellent route; Bryan and Linda did a fine job of linking features on a really nice section of rock. The name of the route is a reference to the Iron Maiden song of the same name.    I listed this route as an 'R' rated climb, but there is no 'R' climbing at the grade of the route. Expect 15-20 foot runouts on 5.8/5.9 climbing (with clean falls) and a couple of 20-25 foot runouts on 5.6/5.7 climbing (with ground or hard slab landing falls).    Pitch one: Climb 25 feet up to the first bolt; there is some 5.7 climbing in this section. Next climb straight up to an obvious gear placement and begin traversing to the right. After 10-15 feet, you will reach a bolt. Now climb up past 4 more bolts (10a) to a two bolt anchor. There is a 15-20 foot runout on 5.9 ish climbing in this section. The rock quality and climbing on this section is fantastic. (10a; 105 feet).    Pitch two: Step right off of the belay and pull up onto a flake/hanging slab and climb amazing 5.6 knobs for 20-25 feet to the top of the flake and your first piece of pro (gear). Next follow 4 bolts up through beautiful, semi-runout smedging on great rock to a two bolt anchor. (5.9; 95 feet)    Pitch three: Climb up off of the belay and climb upwards past 4 bolts (10a). At the fourth bolt, head right towards a right trending flake/ramp and another bolt. Follow the flake upwards; you can get some small cams or nuts in the flake if you like, however the climbing is solid and moderate (maybe 5.5) and most will forgo the gear. Following the ramp, head up past two more spaced bolts (5.9) to a two bolt anchor. (10a; 105 feet).\",\n",

Begin at the southernmost foot of the dome, right of the Great White Book. Scramble up 4th class ledges and low angle rock towards the obvious crack/flake system until it becomes necessary to belay. Depending on your comfort level (or willingness to simul), you can eliminate a lot of belays by pushing the approach high. At the end of the cracks you'll find some wandering, unprotected slabs that lead to the summit. It may be best to head relatively straight up (easier), or to link small features (pro).  In the early season expect the top of the route to be very wet from snow melt on the summit.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This route makes a circular path along the ridge and across the peaks overlooking Budd Lake, on the south side of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park -->    Just hiking (or running) on that ridge for so long with wonderful views in both directions would be great. Even more, it includes some great narrow / arete sections, also some fun climbing peaks which might be too short to justify as an outing individually -- and optionally access to some famous routes (for those who have the speed + endurance + skill to include them).     Actually this route does not include anything like the whole geographical Cathedral Range as shown on maps -- just the northwestern section, which is most accessible to trailheads on highway rt 120, and has lots of fun and spectacular climbing.    Peaks along the way are:      Best climbing - sections with the best climbing are:   . . . offers amazing narrow ridge structures (5.8 or 5.7)   . . . [5.6] offers much more climbing and more interesting).      All latitude/longitude points given below, also other helpful waypoints and tracks, are in a GPX file linked from       Most of the individual peaks were climbed by the 1930s. People were doing the Traverse at least by the 1980s. John Moynier + Claude Fiddler described it (with much less detail than here) in 1993 in , and again in the second edition,  (Falcon.com 2002). Peter Croft described the Cathedral Range traverse (in the opposite direction) in his high Sierra guidebook,  (MaximusPress.com 2002).      Start and finish at the Cathedral Lakes trailhead on route 120 is the simple short way.   For a shorter traverse (or to allow more time for optional Matthes Crest section or Cathedral SE Buttress climb) could ...      For a more difficult traverse:    . . . [5.6] for the normal route around the E side to the NW face.   . . . and traverse it partway (or fully?) toward its N end, then join CRT at Echo Ridge.       Trailhead is at Cathedral Lakes trail (shuttle bus stop) on Tioga Pass highway rt 120 in Tuolumne Meadows. (GPS latitude/longitude approximately N37.8729 W119.3829) (altitude approx 8580ft / 2615meters). About 8.7Miles / 14km west on route 120 from Yosemite National Park east entrance at Tioga Pass.    The plan is first get to Budd Lake, then to the base of the Unicorn climb ...    (1) Start on the Cathedral Lakes trail and go SW about 0.35Mile / 550meter distance, uphill vertical +260ft / +80m) to point (GPS lat/long ~ N37.8693 W119.3867) (altitude ~ 8840ft/2695m)    (2) There turn Left off the main trail (no sign or marking) onto a well-beaten path about two feet wide which starts gentle down, then flat + up a little, then steeper down (then a longer up).    Normally this turn is blocked by one of more logs. It comes about 200ft/70m after the main trail trail curved S up steepish - just after the main trail had curved W up steepish for about 200ft/70m - (and just before the main trail curves W up steepish yet again). Note: The southern endpoint of this second trail is Cathedral Peak, not Budd Lake.    Go roughly S about 0.6Mi / 1000m close to Budd Creek with some ups and downs. Next the trail goes onto a long + wide rock slab area, and at the same time slowly curves to the right - SSW - away from Budd Creek. It\\'s true that one branch of Budd Creek runs down from Budd Lake, but if you try to stay close to this creek, you\\'ll soon be off the trail bushwacking (which is doable and perhaps fun, but more work and time) - and if you follow the obvious east branch, you won\\'t even go to Budd Lake. It\\'s easy to miss the trail here on the slab. The key is to recognize is that the trail often runs between two parallel lines of rocks, with the individual rocks spaced about 3-6ft / 1-2m apart -- and be on the lookout for when those lines curve Right. The slab ends after about 0.25Mi/400m. About another 0.1Mi / 120m there is a move up R on rock, and continue on the dirt trail for another 0.3Mi / 500m to key turn-off point (lat/long ~ N37.8527 W119.3936) (altitude 9540ft / 2910m). This is about 1.0Mi / 1600m from leaving the main Cathedral Lakes trail (with overall gentle uphill of +700ft / +215m).    This turn-off point comes after the Cathedral Peak trail comes in sight of a little creek below its L side, and hooks R around the end of a big fallen tree, then goes gentle down curving L, then roughly flat a short ways aiming straight at a tree. There it\\'s easy to see the Budd Lake trail going off to the L - (At that point the Cathedral Peak trail turns half-R and goes uphill away from the creek.)     (3) Here turn L (SE) off the Cathedral Peak trail (no sign or marking) and cross a small creek on broken logs. This turn is easy to miss. It is often blocked by one or more logs along the side of the Cathedral Peak trail.    This little creek is the west branch of Budd Creek, and the unofficial trail to Budd Lake basically follows this creek. So immediately after crossing the creek, turn R (SW) and start hiking on this (narrower) trail to go generally SSW about 0.7Mi / 1100m (with overall gentle uphill of +460ft / +140m) to the outlet of Budd Lake    (lat/long ~ N37.8431 W119.3973) (alt 10000ft/3050m).    (4) Next objective is to get to the base of the N-NW face of Unicorn Peak.   Go SE (on the E side of Budd Lake) about 0.35Mi / 600m, aiming for a col/saddle above a rock slab slope. The slab is steep-ish, likely requires some wide zig-zags to get up - (wouldn\\'t want to have to come  this when wet).    From the col (10290ft / 3135m), see Unicorn peak to the East across a wide bowl. Go down a little SE, then contour around the bowl, E about 0.3Mi / 500m E, then N about 0.35Mi / 600m to reach a flat/gentle area under the W face of Unicorn Peak.   (lat/long ~ N37.8452 W119.3841) (alt 10270ft/3130m).    Total distance from trailhead about 3.1Mi / 5km, with a total vertical gain about +1840ft / +560m (including some ups + downs).    . . .     high point is the North summit (lat/long ~ N37.8457 W119.3821) (alt ~ 10830ft/3300m). From the E side of the Unicorn, hike upward diagonally around to reach the bottom of the rock of the NNW face. Then climb the rock up to the notch between the north peak and middle peak of the Unicorn -- or aiming for some point between the north summit and the notch. Interesting climbing, and it might be possible to find a way to do this all at the grade of class 4, but it\\'s sustained and not short, so it would not be surprising if some class 5 moves will be encountered.    . . (Alternate way to this notch: Climb the slabs of the W face of the ridge S from the Unicorn toward the talus heap (\"Althuski\"), then go N along the broad ridge.)    Getting from the notch to the N summit is traditionally graded class 4, but one usual way includes an exposed overhanging move (positive holds) - which many people might grade as class 5.   . . (The notch can be reached more easily from the E side from the Lake Elizabeth trailhead, but that requires a car/bus shuttle, and misses out on some interesting climbing.)    Come back down off the N summit the same way. Could also tag some of the other (easier) summits. Or there are some interesting moves along the narrow ridge going south from some of the other Unicorn summits. More interesting if stay more directly on the arete where possible. More exposure to play with if make some moves on the W side.    Next go easy 0.3Mi / 500m S on the broad ridge to the next high spot, sometimes called \"Althuski\" (lat/long ~ N37.8411 W119.3800) (alt ~ 10875ft/3315m). It\\'s a heap of big granite rocks -- fun if you like descending from its top by hopping from rock to rock. Otherwise can be bypassed on its W side.    (lat/long ~ N37.8356 W119.3847) (alt ~ 11060ft/3370m) is about 0.4Mi / 620m SW from the rock heap, but it\\'s more complicated to get there. The easy way to climb the Cockscomb is on its W face -- which is most easily reached by going around its S side ... Perhaps leave the Cockscomb NE ridge fairly early, then horizontal across dirt until fully around the base of the SW end of the peak. - (? a more aesthetic way might be to stay closer to the NE ridge and aim for the notch between the N and S halves of the Cockscomb ? see    . . Other folks report going around the N side of the Cockscomb, or climbing it by its NW face -- or even traversing the peak by its E face and W face (some did not like rock quality on W face).    Descend W to the Cockscomb-Echo col (alt ~ 10660ft/3250m).   . . (If need to retreat from here in wet weather, note that between this pass and Budd Lake are two large steep-ish rock slabs to be descended (slippery?). So consider instead first going down SW then around the S and W sides of the Echo Peaks.)    is optional, but the rock structures on the arete are so interesting (especially the section north from the North summit) that it\\'s tempting to visit it somehow. Several options for embracing or avoiding different sections of the Matthes ridge. See    description and Comments - also    - also Comments on the     - W summit is higher (lat/long ~ N37.8348 W119.3959) (alt ~ 11150ft/3400m) than E summit - (also higher than Cathedral Peak). The upper section of the East arete has wonderful knife-edge sections. Many people grade it as class 4, but might be a low class 5 down-climb move off the E summit.    . . (For maximum fun climbing, try to spend as much time as possible directly on the top of the ridge - \"balls over the razor\" - or make moves across from one side to the other - or look for chances to climb on the steeper side.)   We saw a report that it might be possible to start by climbing somewhere on the N face of the E ridge.    After the high point of Echo Ridge can find some additional narrow arete moves on the West arete a bit lower.    Gentle down to Wilts Col (lat/long ~ N37.8343 W119.4007) (alt ~ 10760ft/3280m) - between Echo Peak 8 at the N end of the east group of Echo Peaks, and Echo Peak 7 at the NE end of the middle group of Echo Peaks.   . . (If need to exit now from this Traverse, it\\'s maximum class 2 from Wilks Col down to Budd Lake and out the trail to the highway 120.)    are numbered 1 to 9, in three groups:    (1) Echo Peaks 1 to 4 form a N-S line on the West, and the arete across peaks 1 to 4 is overall narrow and in some sections knife-edge;    (2) peaks 5 to 7 are the Middle group;    (3) peaks 8 + 9 are the line on the East - (Peak 9 is the most difficult summit to reach).   . . For more on climbing Echo Peaks + Ridge, see R.J.Secor guidebook,  (Mountaineers 2009)    Tallest of all the \"Echos\" is Peak 3 (lat/long ~ N37.8327 W119.4034) (alt ~ 11100ft/3385m) - so the easy fun accomplishment is to get to the summit of high peak 3, and also traverse the narrow arete line between peaks 1 + 2 + 3. The obvious easy way on or off that line is the E side of the col between 1 + 2. From Wilts Col the easy way to get there is to traverse low around the N side of peak 7 and peak 5.    Next a short way to Cathedral Peak is by down-climbing the W side of the col between peak 3 and peak 2. The top section is fun scrambling, but lower down the rock gets loose and with dirt. An obvious way (with less loose rock) is to return to Wilts Col and go N down (on dirt) from there. Another possible short way (not checked by us) is to return to the col between Echo 1 and Echo 5, and go directly N down from there.   . . (If need to exit now from this Traverse, it\\'s non-difficult cross-country travel from Wilts Col to Budd Lake, or from W side of peaks 1-2-3 to hit the trail N below Budd Lake.)    Next hike/run cross-country N about 1 mile / 1700m to the southeast base of the summit cliffs of Cathedral Peak. Likely it\\'s easier to aim a bit east of the cliffs, to hit the normal trail (improved with stone steps) to Cathedral Peak, and finish on that.    (lat/long ~ N37.8478 W119.4055) (alt 10912ft/3326m) has a great summit block with a great view, no matter how you get there. A very attractive option is to climb the much more difficult  [5.6] to the summit of Cathedral Peak - (the usual start for that route is 100-125ft / 30-40m W along the base of the cliff from where the hiking trail meets the cliff.)    The normal route to the summit goes up the trail around E side of the summit cliffs. This trail now has stone steps. It stays pretty close to the base of the cliffs along the E side, at first N, then curves NW. After about 0.15Mi / 230m distance with vertical gain of +390ft / +120m it reaches a barrier. For a nice view / snack spot  the difficult + exposed summit climbing, here turn R and go N thru a narrow slot in the rock to a flat spot. To continue to the summit, scramble up about 25ft diagonal Left, then horizontal Left (W) around the N corner of the summit cliffs, past some bushes to wide ledge on the NE side of the NW face.   . (For a more interesting adventure, do not read the following instructions, instead figure it out for yourself, like John Muir when he was here first in 1869) ...  : Next climb the NW face, likely with some zigzags (many people find it easiest to go all the way over to the SW side), finishing (50-80ft higher) at the NE side of the face. Next diagonal up Right to a notch, and cross the notch to the S face. Traverse horizontally SE about 10ft to the bottom of twin cracks. Climb up those about 12ft to the SW side of the summit block, then to the flat top for a great view.      From the summit of Cathedral Peak, return the same way ... down the twin cracks, across to and down the NW face, around the N corner, and down the E side to the southeast base of cliff. Next down the unofficial Cathedral Peak trail, first steep-ish SE, soon curves NE gentler, later NNE (careful not to lose the trail while on the wide long slab) to meet the official Cathedral Lakes trail. Finally NE down on that back to the trailhead on highway rt 120. (descent distance 2.7 miles / 4.4 km).      see photos for other MountainProject routes ...     .

       "  'description': \"The only thing better than the spectacular Matthes Crest traverse is to link it up with two other classic Tuolumne cruiser routes, the NW Buttress of Tenaya Peak and the SE Buttress of Cathedral Peak.  You also get a sampling of what Tuolumne has to offer, from smooth slabs to wildly exposed knobby fins to choose-your-own adventure crack climbing. These three peaks form an obvious circuit from Tenaya Lake and make a great outing for any Tuolumne enthusiast.  Many options exist for extending the link-up if you haven't gotten your fill.      Note that this route holds snow so it's best to avoid it until dry. The route is shaded in the morning so plan accordingly. There isn't a direct trail from the Tenaya Lake parking lot so either take the trail to the lake until you find the one that heads back NE or trample the meadow and cross-country through the trees toward the left-hand side of Tenaya Peak.  You are aiming for the shrubby ledge system to the left of the route.  As of June 2012 the trail was well worn and cairned.      Supertopo has a blow-by-blow description of the route, but you can just as easily follow the crack systems up the obvious buttress. The route eases you into the steeper, more difficult climbing up higher. Several summit options exist of varying difficulty, including a 5.7ish hand crack and a 4th class option out right. The true summit is southwest of where you'll top out.      From the summit of Tenaya Peak head east between Tressider Peak and Columbia Finger then southeast after crossing the Cathedral Lakes trail to reach the southern end of Matthes Crest.  You'll be able to see  from the Tenaya Peak summit as a bearing point.     It's 2.5 miles as the crow flies and the only place you will likely follow a trail is the final ascent up to the  that marks the start of Matthes.    From the golden boulder choose a line up the knobby crack systems that lead to the ridgeline proper (5.5).  The ridgeline is mostly class 3-4.  If it seems too hard look off to the sides; there is usually an easier ramp down below.  For soloists the easiest way off the south summit is to head back in the direction you came until you can   on the east side of the  can also do a more direct downclimb at 5.7. From here traverse north into the notch that divides the summits.    From the notch mantle onto the ledges until you reach the leftward trending diagonal crack (5.7) which is the official  of the route. Alternate: 5.8 corner offwidth  From here climb the 5.4 chimney on the left side of the ledge to the north summit.    Don't stop now. Continue on for more class 4 to low fifth class exposed fun.  The final tower provides another short section of exposed 5.7 if you wish to partake. If not, you can downclimb off the west side (class 3-4) just prior to the second to the last tower.      From the end of Matthes Crest work your to  to Cathedral's SE Buttress (~1.6 miles as the crow flies).  The most direct route is to aim for notch between Echo Ridge and Echo Peaks (left side of Echo Ridge).  There are multiple routes up the SE Buttress. Refer to Supertopo if you need specifics.  The most recent edition now includes the full traverse.      Echo Ridge (class 4), Echo Peaks (class 3 to 5.7), Eichorn Pinnacle (5.4)      From the top of Cathedral downclimb the 4th class summit blocks to reach the class 3 ledge system.  If you are heading back to the Cathedral Lakes trailhead you will want the high saddle to the NE that leads to the trail that skirts the east side of Cathedral Peak.  If you are heading directly back to Tenaya Lake  slabs/scree and through swamplands to the southern side of the main Cathedral Lake.  You'll find a footpath along the shoreline.  From the western end of the lake follow the drainage down slabs and cobbled river beds toward Tenaya Lake.  I did notice a faint trail in certain section of the drainage but I gave up trying to follow it since it didn't really seem to offer any advantage over going straight down the drainage.  About 1.5 trail miles from the lake you'll come across a bridge that leads to a good trail back to the lake and your car.  The direct line mileage for the entire descent is ~2.7.      Availability of water will vary. In late season the seasonal streams between Tenaya and Matthes may dry up and require a detour to the lakes. The northern slopes below Echo Ridge/Peaks, however, tend to hold snow later and are a more reliable source.  Worst case you can detour to one of the lakes.\",\n",

Step out off the ledge with a lot of air suddenly below your heels and begin to traverse up and left aiming for the short hand crack roof. Once at the small roof, continue straight up that crack all the way to the summit. The entire route overhangs about 8 feet from the base.     The crack gradually widens from 1\" at the small roof to 7\" at the very top. The hand and fist jams are solid and are deep in the flaring slot, while awkward, it provides good rests. The offwidth section is also rounded over and slightly flaring making it tough to get deep enough for solid arm bars, and slightly too flared for good chicken wings, making it quite relentless between rest stances. Irregularities in the width of the upper half of the offwidth make pushing a cam the whole way impractical, so I recommend two #6 cams.    Does anyone have any information on any route history?',\n",

There are two ways to go on the next section. The original route moves right and climbs 5.9 cracks to a horn in one pitch and climbs back left via 5.7 and 5.8 climbing in the next pitch. A direct route is also possible at 5.10 and is popular. This variation climbs directly above the first pitch belay for two pitches, both 5.10, and meets up with the original route where you can belay on the ridge. The 4th pitch is mostly 3rd class and ledgey with some 5th class terrain. It traverses underneath the ridge proper. The final pitch appeared to have some options but should stay left of the ridge, climbing one section of 5.8 and easier climbing before the summit.',\n",

It avoids the regular Matthes Crest start, which can be quite crowded, but it takes much longer to climb, so can only be used to pass the slowest parties.    The climb is mostly knobby face moves on big crystals. The rock quality is good but not great--as of 2010 (3 years after the FA) the route needs some more traffic to break off the most fragile crystals. Lots of edging on knobs for feet, so wear your stiffest shoes.    The topo in the Supertopo guidebook is accurate and easy to follow. (We forgot to bring ours and had a bit of an adventure; the rock quality tends to be poor off route.)     The climb is closer to Narsil than it appears on the topo. The slings at the top of Narsil are just barely visible from the right edge of the Anduril belay ledge (as of 2010 they are red, making them easier to spot).    The Supertopo rates the 1st pitch crux as 10b. It is a very tightly bolted roof, with a bolt immediately below and above; anyone taller than 5\\'2\" or so can clip the bolt above before getting over the roof. Slightly soft for Yosemite 10b--definitely not an old-school sandbag.     The Supertopo calls a short (vegetated) section on the 2nd pitch \"flaring hands,\" and rates it 10a. It\\'s noticeably easier than an old-school sandbagged Yosemite 5.9 (e.g., Phobos/Deimos, Reeds Direct). Make sure to stay on the right-side arete and crack on this pitch; the rock deteriorates badly on the left side near the top, and the climbing is harder too.

Generally, people do the traverse from South to North. This is because the crest slopes upwards in that direction and therefore you will end up at a higher elevation. Doing it North to South would involve more downclimbing.    Probably best to Simul or Solo much of the route.  To rope up for every single pitch would take a horrendous amount of time.    Start the climb at the South face above a patch of pine trees and stay a bit left. The climbing is <5.6 here and climbs very textured / featured rock upwards onto the ridge. Follow the path of least resistance. Once on the crest itself, just follow it along. When in doubt, check out both sides of the crest and traverse along the easier one. The crux of the climb comes on the left side (West) of the crest directly below the South Summit. Strenuous and physical climbing up a good crack leads to easier climbing and then the summit. Sign the register.    From the South Summit: Do not rap, but rather climb back down the ridgetop for 100' and traverse past on easy ledges on the East side of the South Summit. Trying to rap often results in snagged ropes here.    OR   Simply continue the traverse and downclimb the next section, placing pro for the follower.    Down into the notch between the two summits, then some 5.7 moves to get up onto the (higher) North summit.    Some parties stop at the notch between the two summits and rappel down the very wide gully on the west side of the notch, straightforward with a single 60-meter rope. There are rock horns along the south side (descender's left). Might be slings/cord already in place, but safer to bring your own webbing/cord material and rappel rings.     From the North Summit: Many parties stop here and rappel off the crest. Two double-rope rappels on the West side is easiest, but many parties have done it by three or four rappels with a single 60-meter rope -- see Comments on the route ).     Some of the rappels are on natural anchors, so bring some webbing/sling/cord (and rappel rings) in case the stations need new webbing.    Continuing the climb offers great climbing, but the climbing difficulty increases so it is recommended you be solid at the grade.  I'd say some of the downclimbing was 5.8.    Retreat:   It is probably best to bail off the West side at just about any point.  There appear to be many rap stations at random intervals on the face.  Multiple short rappels are best.  Be prepared to leave slings and or gear.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Amazing narrow fin of granite, above an ocean of granite. Variety of interesting moves, unfogettable rock structures, sustained for more than a thousand feet of climbing.    More interesting and narrow than the South ridge (which is what most roped parties do and call the \"traverse\" of the Matthes Crest). Said by some long-time Sierra climbers to be their favorite ridge traverse. More ... is it the best moderate ridge in USA?    . (All latitude/longitude points given below, also other helpful waypoints and tracks, are in a GPX file linked from    )    At least one of the 5.8 sections can be avoided, and much of the reputation of difficulty comes from people trying this ridge in the downward direction. So someone  find some navigation in the upward direction which keeps all the difficulty at 5.7 or less. Look forward to seeing experiences about this in the Comments.   :   Starting from the Cathedral Lakes trailhead on Tioga Pass highway route 120 (GPS latitude/longitude approx N37.8729 W119.3829) (altitude ~ 2615m). Follow the Approach instructions for the    as far as the N end of Budd Lake (lat/long ~ N37.8431 W119.3973) (altitude ~ 3050m).    From the N end of Budd Lake, hike SSW about 0.6mile/1000meters up toward the Echo Peaks, which are west of the broad Echo Ridge, which is west of the Cockscomb peak and the Echo-Cockscomb col. The objective is to cross \"Wilts col\" (lat/long ~ N37.8343 W119.4007) (alt ~ 3280m), which is between the East group of the Echo Peaks and the Middle group of the Echo Peaks. Actually for much of the approach you can\\'t see the East group, so perhaps just aim for the obvious wide steep dirt/scree gully facing north which is to the left of the (visible) Echo Peaks. This slope often has a zig-zag track, or snow in springtime).    Next (instead of continuing over and down the other side of \"Wilts Col\") turn Left (East) and hike gently up about 100 yards/meters to go around the N side of Echo Peak 8, then diagonal down SouthEast about 100 yards/meters between Echo Peaks 8+9 and Echo Ridge, then horizontal traverse East about 0.2mile / 300 meters on big talus under the south side of Echo Ridge and so reach the north end (N37.8333 W119.3944) of the North ridge of Matthes Crest.    . . (or could save a little distance by finishing diagonal SE and scramblingup onto the crest of the North ridge farther south closer to the mini-towers.)    Walk S on the ridge about 500m mostly flat, perhaps some scrambling moves. Meet some big \"pancake\" rocks, then the North mini-tower (lat/long ~ N37.8269 W119.3958) (altitude ~ 3225m).   : First do one or more peaks of the     : First do the beginning of the    :    Overall the north ridge has four sections ... from N to S:      Some of the more difficult moves are:     : Up the North end of the N mini-tower, belay near its summit. Crux move not more than 5.6 in upward direction (one party used #2 Camalot to protect), but might feel like 5.7 going down, more intimidating not knowing what it\\'s leading to below. Traverse a little near the summit then find a way down the South end into the notch between the two mini-towers. One party tried the E side (not more than 5.6) and protected with cams up to #1 Camalot and a couple of long slings around protrusions -- careful, at least one flake with obvious slot behind it seems a big suspect). Possible belay stance could be at flake below E side of notch.    North end of South mini-tower looks pretty difficult to take directly. Easier to first traverse around to its W side, perhaps after dropping down 10 feet below notch, then rising traverse on narrow ledges (one party protected with smaller cams). Then choose where to switch to climbing upward to the crest -- at least three different options -- what looks to be most protectable is to aim for the straight-up crack which finishes roughly at the summmit (width range 1-2 inches, took standard protection fairly well, difficulty around 5.7-5.8). (for those traveling S->N, getting  this NW side could seem more intimidating - see ideas in Comments). Belay anchor rock horns near summit. Getting down the South end of South mini-tower is not as difficult.    One guidebook seems to imply that most parties should plan on just skipping the mini-towers (see Variations 1 and 2 below). This is assuming they are going in the S->N direction (which seems more difficult and intimidating through the mini-towers). Also roped parties will find the mini-towers slow because it makes sense to set up belays both near the two summits and in the notches. And many roped parties traversing in S->N direction are getting low on time and energy by the time they reach the mini-towers.    But the mini-towers are key parts of what makes the Matthes Crest such a remarkably great climb, so it\\'s worth at least taking a \"nibble\" on them -- especially parties going in the N->S direction. Parties going S->N might consider tagging the summit of the South mini-tower, then returning to the notch at its South end, then use Variation 1 below to pass around their W side to the N end of the N mini-tower, then climb the N mini-tower up and back before finishing easily to the end of N ridge.   : It\\'s possible to avoid both mini-towers by going below on their West side. In the N->S direction, see an obvious non-narrow ledge system roughly horizontal and walk S on that, then when roughly under the notch at S end of S mini-tower, go upward to reach the crest, with some thoughtful moves and zig-zagging to keep the difficulty at class 3.    In the S->N direction, from near the notch by the S end of South mini-tower, start down W side, at first diagonal down back S a little ways, then traverse 10-15 feet north, then down a wide vertical crack with positive holds inside or nearby to reach non-narrow ledge system, and walk North on that.    is an alternative which more completely avoids both mini-towers, and perhaps make the approach or return a little easier. See under Comments below for details.     section: About a thousand feet with lots of fun non-difficult narrow-arete-traverse moves, but also some thoughtful vertical \"steps\" about 10-15 ft each (easier to figure out in the upward N->S direction).   : One of the \"steps\" leads to a slightly-overhanging traverse section on the E face about 10-15ft wide, with about a hundred feet of open air underneath. Felt around 5.8, don\\'t know about protection - (hopefully we\\'ll start seeing some detailed guidance for that below in the Comments). Anyway it\\'s    . . avoidable: Go down the gully on W side about 20ft, a couple of thoughtful moves up out of S side of gully, then diagonal SE up to crest.   : Most parties get up to (or down from) the North summit by climbing close to the arete. The East and West sides have different styles of climbing moves and protection possibilities. Key sequence by bottom of arete has stemming and jamming moves, around 5.7 (but those lacking solid jamming technique will find it harder, and soloists should feel very confident in their jamming to take this on). Hand-size cam is useful for protection, and about half of hand-width for a smaller crack alongside.    Not far north from base of arete, lots of people do a stemming / step-across move over an exciting gap, also mentioned in a modern guidebook - (photos see link further below). But this might be avoidable by going below the crest on the East side.    This N summit is the highest on the Matthes Crest.   :    Rappel down the W side of the N summit. Some recent guidebooks and most websites say that double-ropes are needed for these rappels, but recently some parties have been rappeling down the W side of N summit with a single 60-meter rope (see the Comments below, also ).   : Return back north down the North ridge (for maximum enjoyment of great arete climbing). Could use Variation 1 (or Variation 2) to shorten this.   : Down-climb the SW side of N summit into the notch between the S summit and N summit. Could be tricky doing this on-sight as a down-climb -- some moves will likely feel like 5.7 -- see details in  description and Comments. Also the SuperTopo guidebook has a detailed topo for this section. Then make rappels with a single rope in the gully down the West side of the notch (rock horns on the south side of the gully. Down-climb? Lower section can be down-climbed at 3rd class with a few moves of 4th class. But there\\'s a short upper section with down-sloping holds at 5th class (unless trust a delicate-looking flake?).   : Climb South down the South ridge -- finishes with three or two downward pitches including some 5.5 moves (one guidebook suggests this would be difficult) -- rappel options unknown. For more info see    :   Could just go back over Wilts Col ... but if did one of the rappel descents, then it\\'s less work to instead make a traverse W low under the S side of Echo Peaks, then a rising traverse over a broad shoulder (lat/long ~ N37.8373 W119.4060) (alt ~ 10300ft/3140m) on the W side of Echo Peaks. Then down toward Budd Lake - or a little shorter is to aim for a bit R (E) of Cathedral Peak, go gently down until meet the unofficial Cathedral Peak trail, down on that and it joins the Approach route.

Recommend \"alpine\" trad rack plus additional long runners/slings for around horns and thru holes.

In such cases it might be appropriate for the less-capable climbers to go first and place Trad protection which the more-capable climber going last could remove (or leave).

Interesting climbing to reach the highest N summit, but pretty short compared to the approach (shortest from the East side).     Difficulty of the N summit traditionally rated class 4, but one obvious way of doing it has a slightly overhanging (or at least fully vertical) move with exposure to a deadly fall - seems more like class 5.   . (If you\\'re more of a scrambler than a serious rock-climber ... unless you\\'re partnered with someone with a rope who knows how to use it for protection ... better to plan toward getting only the Middle summit, perhaps along with the higher mountain less than half a mile south along the same ridge as the Unicorn.)   : Trailhead is at Tuolumne Meadows campground (along S side of highway 120 about 8 miles W from the Yosemite N.P. east entrance at Tioga Pass) near group camp, the B loop. Bear-proof boxes for day-hiker food storage.    Take the Elizabeth Lake trail South about 2.3 miles / 3.7 km (with vertical gain 900 ft / 270 meters) to near Elizabeth Lake. Hike / scramble up the East (or NE) slope of the Unicorn to the notch between the middle summit and the north summit (vertical gain approx +1300 ft / 400 meters).   : The highest North summit is close to the notch, so it\\'s tempting to want to \"go for it\", but it\\'s not so easy. One way to get there is to cross over to the W side of the notch, then make an exposed short traverse N. Next up to the crest of the ridge, perhaps a little to its other side, then perhaps a delicate move up, and on to the summit. Before committing to any move, keep in mind you\\'ll have to do it again on the way back.    Middle summit is easier climbing and less exposed.   : Return the same way.   Some people like to also climb the (higher) hump about 0.3 miles / 500 meters to the South along the broad ridge - which is fun if you like scrambling on big granite talus.   Or to play with additional exposed climbing moves, can find some in traversing the other Unicorn summits and narrow S ridge.   : Total horizontal distance about 2.9 miles / 4.7 km.

Higgins returned in 1973 with Mike Irwin. This route set a very high standard for face climbing style and difficulty in its day.     This route is really nice and one of the longest routes on Fairview. The route essentially follows the northwest nose of Fairview, climbing corners, flakes and cracks connected by runout face sections. An incredible full pitch face traverse right under the main roof allows escape to a bouldery crux face pitch and moderate climbing above to the U-shaped bowl and the summit.     All bolts on this route are excellent, recently replaced by the ASCA except the first one and one at the belay at the start of the traverse as of 2016.',\n",

Pitch 1: Start on the right side of the north face apron, about where the access trail exits the forest.  Head up and left following a steep 3rd class ramp to a belay at an obvious roof and right facing dihedral.  This belay is shared with Wonderful Wino (5.10b R).

Pitch 2:  This great pitch moves up and left from the belay on large knobs, run it out about 30 feet to an obvious thin right facing corner 5.6R and jam some small to medium cams in the bottom.  Continue on ever diminishing knobs left and up past 3 very hard to see bolts.  5.10a friction getting to the 3rd bolt.  From the third bolt, head up and right to a hidden left facing corner more 5.10a friction.  Climb the corner (5.8) and jam all the gear in it you can (tricky thin to 2\").  From the top of the corner move straight left about 30-40 feet onto the slabby face and eventually the roof (whimpering 5.9R).  Good 1\"-3\" cams for gear at roof.  Lieback and stem the roof (5.8) to a huge ledge with a bolted belay.  5.10a - 200 feet - long slings/double ropes help.    Pitch 3: Climb the enjoyable grassy right facing dihedral, past an overlap, until it rolls over to become a roof.  Face climb on big knobs around the right side of the roof.  Immediately traverse 15 feet left on a sloping ledge directly over the roof to a nice belay at a right facing flake.  Gear belay thin to 1\" - 5.8 - 100 feet.    Pitch 4: Traverse straight left 30 feet on a sloping slabby ledge to a vertical thin crack 5.8.  There is no gear on the traverse but the hardest move is the first.  Place small TCU\\'s and small stoppers and climb the thin crack 20 feet to a good fixed stopper and pin 5.9.  Follow this crack up and left to the roof (5.10a) and lieback a finger crack over the roof at a large left facing dihedral.  Once above the roof, follow the dihedral with a finger crack 20 feet, the right arete is super knobby and useful here (5.7).  Place gear and climb around the arete to the face, up and right 20 feet on good knobs to a thin seam for gear (5.8R).  Step down and right to grassy belay area.  Gear belay thin to 3\" - 5.10a - 100 feet.    Pitch 5: Follow the excellent grassy finger crack - left facing dihedral above for 200 feet to a large ledge at the base of the 5.6 ramp pitch of the Regular Route.

       "  'description': 'This is a relatively new addition to Fairview, so expect brand new shiny bolts along with the usual crumbly dime edges and bolt spacing that puts hair on your chest. The route follows a very close line to the Regular route. Scramble up to the same stance where you would start reg. route. The topo is very good and easy to follow. All day sun in June with a few shadier corners in the morning, a.m. shade closer to September.  1. Angle up and left on ledgy terrain to a bolt from where the difficulty increases until the crux at the end. Expect 15-20 ft spacing between bolts on 5.10+ dime edges and almost hold-less friction crux towards the top. \\xa07 bolts and a #2 cam. 45 m 11b PG  2. Take the left crack to a belay ledge around on the left arete. Gear. 25 m 5.9  3. Up though the junky rock to a mix of bolted face and intermittent cracks. Watch the ends when rappelling. 35 m 10b  4. Heads-up climbing through a small roof above a bolt and couple of pieces of gear is followed by sustained edging between more closely-spaced bolts. 30 m 11a  5. Start up the loose pillar and clip the lone bolt out right avoiding the roofs above. A couple of moves will bring you over to the crescent ledge and easy terrain. Scramble up to the ledge up and right with the bolted anchor. 25 m 10b  6. This pitch is the reason why I suggested an R rating for the otherwise PG route. Move left to the ramp to gain a foot \"ledge\" that will bring you back right to the point above the belay. Do a couple more slabby 5.9 moves (ok feet, but no hands) to clip the first of 2 bolts. You are almost soloing this section since a fall would result in broken legs before the rope will catch you. The difficulty eases slightly when you are about 20\\' above the bolt and almost to the 2nd one. Follow easy cracks to the anchor just below the roofs. 2 bolts and 3-4 pieces. 30 m 11a R  7. Go left to pull over the roof and face climb back right to the knobby crack system. This brings you to the last bolted anchor on the route. Gear. 15 m 5.9  8. Easy 5.7 crack straight up. Scramble another 350\\' to the summit and walk off to the west (right) or rap without doing this pitch. \\xa0 Can be rappelled with 1 70 m rope with some downclimbing on p1 (about 20\\' of 5.6). All anchors are bolted with rap rings except for p1 (shared with the regular route), so a sling needs to be left on the tree if rapelling.',\n",

All-in-all the rock isn't quite as good as the Regular Route, but it is much steeper -- it's a toss up as to which one is the better route.    P1: Begin by a large block that is leaning against the dome.  Head up on somewhat low angle terrain with limited opportunities for pro, do a tough step left, then contour up and right and belay on an obvious platform ledge below the beginning of a long left-facing corner system.  5.9.

P3: Climb up the finger crack past a crux move, and then onwards up a steep, left-leaning crack to a good belay.  5.10d.  I believe there is a 5.9 variation out right near the start that avoids the hard climbing but that it is of lesser quality.    P4: Continue up the steep corner using the crack and knobs.  5.9.

The bolts aren't exactly where you want or need them but where they could be drilled.   Though the hardest move is protected fairly well.  The second pitch is probably the mental crux with only 5 bolts in 200' of sustained 5.10 climbing with one 10+ move way above a bolt.  This pitch might be tad longer than 200' so be ready to simul a small bit or bring a longer rope.      Pitch 4 shares some climbing with an unreported route, Quasimodo,  established by Tom Carter back in the day.  Really fun and exposed pitch.  Pitch 5 holds the hardest technical bits and require solid footwork and mantling ability.  The end of this pitch pulls a really cool roof that Fairest of All traverses underneath.  This actually makes a much better exit for Fairest of All as it avoids the funky and long traverse out right.  Hemispheres could also be exited this way.    Overall this is high quality and extremely engaging route on excellent rock.  Classic Fairview Dome.    Possibly only repeated once by Bob Jensen and Sean Kriletich less than a week after the FA.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This route takes a nice line to the left of the Great Pumpkin.  It is a quasi \"old school\" route designed for the leader who has their lid screwed on pretty tight.  There are some lengthy runouts on easy ground and a spot of routefinding thrown in for good measure.  The knobs are dandy and the polish is mirrorlike.  It is said this route is a better version of the Great Pumpkin.  Maybe give this one a try instead of standing in line over at the Pumpkin.    Pitch #1: Motor up the easy corner and lob in a few cams as you go. There is a bolt at the top of the corner before you start moving right and into a few cruxy moves. Watch out for rope drag. 3 bolts total on the pitch, then a 4 bolt (two that are good) belay.    Pitch #2: Undercling up an left out of the station on some very loose plates. Clip the bolt and begin to move right and up and across the polish. You can stuff some small gear into a flake after you move right and climb up a bit. Eventually get to the right facing corner where you can lob in a nut or some cams. Belay is at the top of this corner. 3 bolts on the pitch, then a 2 bolt belay.    Pitch #3: Run it out straight up to a bolt and then continue moaning upward and slightly right. If you are lucky you will find a small flake that takes 3/4\" to 1\" cams. Continue straight up from this flake until you either hit a rusted 1/4\" bolt or the anchor. 1 good bolt, and 1 bad hidden bolt on the pitch, then a 2 bolt belay.    Pitch #4: Go up toward the big roof and maybe plug in a 1.5\" cam as you turn the corner. Exit the roofs on the right via a 5.4 ramp and look for a fixed pin about half way out. Run the rope all the way back onto the slab to belay. Overlaps up there will take small to medium cams for an anchor. No bolts, set an anchor on top.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Pitch 1: 5.10a, 200 feet. Warmup pitch and headgame wellness check. To begin, follow two bolts and juggy knobs over a 5.9 bulge. Trend up and left to features that accept gear. Climb up to a stance then up nice knobs past 2 bolts. Another thinner feature above will accept a micronut and protect the moves up and right to another stance and bolt. A 2 bolt anchor equipped with rings is ten feet above that.  Pitch 2: 5.10c, 175 feet. Climb up and left to the obvious rightward trending crack system. Climb it until a fixed pin is reached, then break out onto the face to the left, reach juggy knobs and climb to a good stance above. Climb the bolt protected 10c flake and knobby face. The flake is hollow and detached but solid to climb on.  Pitch 3: 5.11a, 130 feet. Stellar! Climb the easy feature up and left towards the beautiful orange bulge. Clip three bolts while working through the awesome 11a sequence that leads to a right facing corner. Place gear in the top of the corner then climb the face to the left, straight up past another bolt to the anchor.  Pitch 4: 5.10a, 165 feet. Follow three bolts up and left over patina, knobs, and edges. Climb up, placing pro in the two shallow right facing systems. Ignore the old off-route bolt off to the right. Gain the knobs and 3 bolts that guide you up and left to an anchor below the corner/roof/arch.  Pitch 5: 5.9, 165 feet. Climb the right facing corner then step left to steep but good knobs and a bolt. Climb up and trend right over moderate terrain, placing gear in several overlaps as you go. Terrain is 5.7ish but knobs are more friable up here (unlike the generally stellar rock quality of the other pitches). Bolted anchor on stance marks the route's summit.  Great route with some stellar climbing.  All anchors are on good stances or ledges.  A legit Fairview route, expect 5.9R climbing and headgame elements to every pitch. However, all harder climbing is protected.  All hardware is modern, stainless, and bomber.  Enjoy!\",\n",

The 11b crux on pitch 7 involves monkeying on jugs through a roof - a very memorable pitch. Second hardest pitch (pitch 2 at 11a) involves sustained edging and is great for testing your mettle before jumping on the more scantily protected lines as the falls are reasonably safe. The topo is easy to follow. It seemed like everyone I knew climbed the route shortly after the FA (ca. 2009), but it has since fallen into obscurity. I thought that it is one of the finest offerings on the dome, so go get on it.',\n",

It took me 5 partners over 3 seasons of weekend trips to finish the route. The 'village' also includes those friends who aren't with us anymore. This route is dedicated to Zach Orman who died in a paragliding accident in 2013. He was an inspiring friend in my life and my thoughts were with him often while adventuring down in the canyon.  This is a beautiful 5 pitch line up an unnamed wall. \\xa0One of many such walls in the GCT. The route faces south and bakes in the sun so later season or an early start are key for the crux slab moves. The route is mostly crack climbing with some face climbing cruxes thrown in. Pitches 2 and 3 are beautiful and require a variety of crack techniques. Pitch 4 is the crux and is entirely face climbing with 4 bolts protecting the harder moves. The crux is on near vertical techy crimpy slab. After the bolts the climbing eases and follows beautiful golden edges with intermittent pro. This part is runout but never harder than 5.8. Pitch 5 features a mix of crack and face with one bolt. The route could continue to the right of the 5th pitch anchor along a weakness and then up a 30 ft slab to another massive ledge. Then there is another 300-400 ft dome above. Go get it!  The next party that goes up may want to bring some webbing and/or quicklinks and rap rings to add to the 1st and 2nd pitch anchor. Webbing up there is probably getting sun baked.  \",\n",

I can\\'t decide what is more sick...Peter Croft\\'s onsight solo or Walt Shipley\\'s after doing the route roped and knowing what to expect!!    The route is exciting and physical and a must do for the High Sierra tick list.     Pitch 1: 3 options...Center option is a groove to a roof (slightly loose) (9+, 115\\').    Pitch 2: Easiest free version is to step down and traverse right on the lower crack approximately 20\\' where its possible to move back up to the upper crack at a good jug in between. Clip a pin and wiggle up to a roof. Fun finger/hand crack changes to a lieback to a sloping ledge where you can go left or right to end on the upper ledge with multiple 3rd pitch options (10, 200\\').    Pitch 3: If on the right side of the upper ledge...Go up a flake to a broken left facing corner and a piton belay on a ledge (8+, 120\\').    Pitch 4: Pick the easiest run out path to the corner chimney (which you don\\'t really chimney, stay outside) (7+, 110\\').    Pitch 5: Hand and fists in the corner to a 6-7\" OW/stem over a bulge passing old bolts. Continue up the 7-8\" OW/Squeeze with a lonely old bolt to a a good ledge (10, 150\\'). #3 and #4 BigBro\\'s may be nice.    Pitch 6: Go right on the ledge and up the obvious left facing corner with two bolts. At the second bolt make a wild traverse right to the finger cack groove with a squeeze finish to a jumbled ledge (10-, 190\\').    Pitch 7: Move right and up a bizarre corner system with a strenuous lieback. Follow broken rock to a sloping ledge under a flared goove (9+, 190\\').    Pitch 8: Up the groove and follow the natural weakness for a 190\\' pitch (5.5).    Pitch 9: 200+\\' fourth class loose grooves to the summit. ',\n",

Stretch the rope out and belay at the best stance you can find.    P3:  Traverse right.  Save small cams for the crux.  Belay after turning the corner into a right-facing dihedral, or stretch the rope further to a better stance.    P4:  Continue traversing right and eventually end up on easy terrain leading to the descent.  Alternatively, climb the excellent Jailbreak Finish, or reverse the entire traverse for more fun.    Finding the route is somewhat difficult (moreso than most other climbs in the Meadows).

Start about 200 feet down and south (right) from the start of Direct NW Face, look for a low angle seam/crack on the face right near the edge of a recess on the right side of the apron.  Pitch 1: Head up the low angle crack as it heads up and right, as it bends further right find a nice 1-2\" cam placement and head up and left on the slab past two hard to see and well spaced bolts to a new double bolt anchor/rap. 5.7(5.6R) - 180 feet.  Pitch 2: Head up and right up ever steeper and harder face climbing with nice holds and good rests past 8 bolts to a double bolt anchor/rap. 5.9 - 180 feet.  From here you can do two double rope rappels from the fixed anchors or continue up Direct NW Face. If you choose to continue up, dirty slab up and right past an old rusty 1/4\" bolt on slabby ledges and then back left to join the second to last pitch of Direct NW Face - one move of 5.9R.',\n",

One could clip the first bolt with a longer runner to completely eliminate drag, but it's not bad either way.    From the first bolt, climb on a diagonal mostly up and to the left for 6 more bolts.    At this point, there is a short section of slab Supertopo describes as 5.7, which this climber thought felt considerably easier, especially for the Meadows. You could take up some small gear, around green/yellow Alien sized, however if you haven't had trouble up to here, you most likely don't need it to get to the chains.    In general, whenever difficulty is encountered, the best course of action is to move further left, and then up. Positive holds abound.    Descent: Not sure on route length, but rapping on a single 60m rope will easily get you back to the belay ledge.\",\n",

There is a good bolt that protects the face friction to gain the corner / lieback about 15' from the belay shrub.  Then follow the lieback up to some broken ledges until you reach another belay shrub.  Avoid the steep crack that looks harder than 5.6 (5.9) or charge up it with good pro.    P2: 5.6 or less. Continue up the broken ledges and up a short crack that accepts wider pro.  Finish near the lip with a gear anchor wherever is convenient.

For Sandbag, stay in the rightmost crack.  Nice climbing up a right facing corner that eventually roofs out right.  Pull around to reach ledge/rail.  Clip bolt then move up and right connecting rails with one fat mantle being the crux.   Good stuff.  Head up placing gear in a seam that eventually dead ends.  Reach up and left to a slanted and a bit hard to see rail and climb up to ledge system.  Move right a few feet and clip pin (there is gear) in right facing corner.  Climb corner until it starts to arch right and turn to choss.  Before choss pull out to left arete on bulbous heads to eventually gain belay ledge.  Long pitch. 220+ ft  Steep and fun!',\n",

An awesome #.75/#1 Camalot sized layback (wish it kept going) takes you to a crack in the face which splits off from the now wide corner. Definitely some looseness here and wedged blocks to yard (softly) on. Gently stuff yourself underneath the roof (#3 Camalot) and surf out left. Don't go over the falls! This tricky but cool move/rest sets you up to place Yellow Alien size pro which will protect as you undercling, jam and stretch for the wide crack of Arms Race and a welcome no hands, perfect knee lock rest. Cool layback and jamming continues to a junky manchor which is best bypassed to a set of Fixe rings out left (30M communal rap).\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Excellent rock, and varied climbing make this a nice casual outing. Start off the right end of the ledge described under the rock section, in a left facing dihedral. This dihedral is obvious when looking at the crag from the road as the crescent shaped crack splitting the dome, sort of right-center with a smooth-ish face to it's left.    Pitch one (5.6) climbs the easy dihedral for about 70 feet, and then traverses straight right around the corner to a belay.     Pitch two (5.7) climbs a short steep crack, sort of up & left from the belay, and heads back to the main corner for a semi long pitch with good crack.    Pitch 3 (5.7) is a classic. It goes up the corner a few more feet, then traverses out onto the face towards a bolt. Clip the bolt, then go up huge vertical jugs on a golden face for about 100 feet. You basically have to run out this section. It is steep, but the jugs and knobs are gigantic. I tried slinging a chickenhead about halfway through the runout, but, it wasn't happening. No worries though, it is all positive. The pitch meets back up with the corner for a belay.    Pitch 4 (5.7) goes the rest of the way up the corner, and jogs out to the face for a couple moves. Top out on a really nice summit.    Walk off to the climbers left down an easy gully. Don't go too far left, you are looking for a narrow gully system. Reverse the walk off for Drug Dome once at the bottom of Mariuolumne Dome.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Old-school route, expect run-out (to very run-out) sustained face climbing. Not a great route if you're trying to break in at the grade, but of you are comfy on run-out 5.10 face and crack climbing, this offers some of the best climbing in Tuolumne, hands down. A great example of a 5 star route that is just as quality as many classics, but doesn't get done that often.    Pitch 1: Climb the fist crack for about 40 feet, then up and left in to an unlikely looking crack that had some bushes in it. You can also climb the fist crack to the end, but that makes the crux before the pin harder (and has worse fall potential).     Pitch 2: This is where the first cruxy bit is. This pitch is tough to describe because it wanders around a bit.    Pull the bulge (2 options, both 5.10 and both with crappy fall potential), then clip a fixed pin and move up and right to a bolt (all bolts are new and shiny, thanks ASCA!). Make a long traverse right here--again, a crappy fall for both leader and second. Follow this to the Dike Crack, an awesome thin crack with pretty good feet where you need them. Bolted belay here. If you're a baller and don't place much pro, you can run these two pitches together.     Pitch 3: Another cruxy section, but both protected by bolts. After the second bolt (a tough traverse right) gets you to the tit flake. Pro is good here, but make sure you're placing it behind the thicker parts of the flake, not the thin parts, as pro would probably not hold. You can belay here at the top of the flaky bit (70 feet), or just keep going, which I recommend if you have a 70.     Pitch 4: Head up the obvious hand crack. At this point your mind is probably pretty blown at the quality of the climbing. Supertopo say don't keep going to the big cave as there is no pro, but this is not true, up and left part of the cave has a nice crack for 3 smallish cams or stoppers. Do not belay at the loose block on the right edge of the cave, it is hollow.    Pitch 5: 2 options, go up the dike for the 5.9 R/X version (felt pretty X to me...) or up and right for the 5.8 R version.        As said above, if you have a 70M rope, you can combine this into 3 pitches.\",\n",

If it weren't for all that, this would be a 4 star classic and one of the best pitches in Tuolumne. The variety of climbing, wild exposure up high, and sustained burliness make this a great and full-value climb worth hopping on if you're solid at the grade. And more traffic would clean it up a little and make it even better.  Climb the left-slanting jam crack which has everything from thin hands to offwidth. At a ledge in an alcove you can either belay or link it all together into one 11a+ megapitch. Stem and lieback out the steep alcove and into some chossy rock. Climb up the steep crack with face holds and into the final corner. The corner looks crazy steep from the ground but you're actually on your feet for this part. Knob climb and lieback to a bolted anchor. A little more easy 5th class leads above the anchor to the summit.  The crux is getting up to the bottom of the finishing dihedral. There's decent pro but it's a little stressful climbing because the rock is decomposed.\",\n",

Also, the supertopo guide notes that Jake Whittaker put it up freesolo (!) and that it was later bolted by a party unaware of the fact it had been climbed.  The FA expressly gave permission for the bolts to remain, I\\'d like to thank him for that generousity, so that mere mortals like myself could enjoy this excellent route.    From the large belay ledge atop p2 of Piss Easy, follow the 4\" wide golden dike that trends up and left on very polished and slick granite, surmounting a few small overlaps.  Fun thin slab moves all the way to the top, with a couple mantels.  End at a hole in the rock with two bolts equipped with rap anchors.    Descent:  I think you are supposed to rap down and left 50\\' to the Shagadelic anchors, then do two double rope raps to the ground.  We didn\\'t know this, and tried to go straight to the p1 shagadelic rap anchors directly below on the big ledge.

The first pitch is a bit notorious as well -- it tackles the massive roof just left of the Yawn.  But the upper pitches are excellent and not to be missed!    P1:  Climb the roof.  Crazy, unlikely stemming!  Belay at a bolted anchor.  5.11d, 90'.    P2:  Head up a steep crack in the corner.  Eventually the angle eases off as do the difficulties.  Stretch the rope out to an obvious ledge system that trends up and right into a ramp.  Belay at the highest point possible on this ramp.  5.10c, 180'.    P3:  There are three options:  Heading out left around the buttress above, or right (junky), or up through the middle -- this is supposedly the best, and is what we did.  Climb up easy ground over some stacked blocks to below the ominous roof above.  Place some gear in the solid rock above and jam and lieback your way up through the roof, finally to a welcome rest stance.  Strenuous!  Continue up the beautiful hand crack above (hopefully you've saved some gear), only stopping at a large, flat ledge near the end of the rope.  5.10d, 190'.    P4:  Continue up the remaining 15' of crack, situate some gear, then traverse right to a knobby face.  Follow this up into an easy corner system and again run the rope all the way out to 4th class near the summit.  5.8, 200'.    Walk off to the west, up over the summit, down the slabs, and back under the main face of Medlicott, back to your packs.  Long, but quite easy.\",\n",

This pitch can be a bit dirty and wet. You are aiming for a shallow right-facing layback feature. Do not head up into the main corner/roofline! Belay just above the layback feature. (See beta photo below).  P2, 160\\', 5.9+- Get ready to sweat! Start the leaning crack by pulling over several chockstones/flakes. The jams are bomber, but the body position, awkward. Enter the maw! OW and squeeze your way through the flare. Strike a balance between the security of the back of the flare, and the slightly easier climbing towards the outside of the flare. I had success pushing a #4 C4 through much of the first half of the flare. Emerge, catch your breath, and climb easy liebacking on the right side of the flake. Belay under the roof, or continue to the bottom of the 5.7 \"hand\" crack to set up for pictures!  P3, 130\\', 5.7- Route-finding is a no-brainer. Follow the stunning \"hand\" crack in the back of the giant flare. Stem/chimney, or jam straight in. Your choice! Belay wherever, but if you are still hauling a pack, stop and belay somewhere to facilitate a clean haul.  P4, 175\\', 5.8ish- Keep following the right-facing feature. Pull around a bulge. The terrain eases from there. Stop atop a giant sandy ledge. There is a stout tree for a belay.  To top out, move left, and 4th class your way up some terraces, before cutting right along ledges to a saddle on top of the dome. Generally, the hardest climbing through this section is not exposed, but some climbers may opt to continue using a rope...',\n",

V3/V4 boulder problem, and all that that implies about the grade, gets you established above the bulge, clip another bolt. continuous 5.11- climbing gets you to a left facing flake that would take a .75 camalot, I believe. Follow the flake to the anchor. Relatively well protected, though pounding into the slab would not be pleasant.   Steep right off the belay and clip a bolt, no factor 2 falls. Look up, compose yourself and set off on through the slightly overhanging sea of knobs passing 3 bolts in 120\\' on the way to the next anchor. One of the BEST pitches ANYWHERE, if this was on East Cottage and had 6 bolts you would have to wait in line all day just to get on it.   Less steep that the previous 2 pitches with hard moves right off the belay and again the last 10\\' before getting to the horizontal. Traverse right about 30\\' to the next anchor, using stoppers and thin cams to protect the traverse.   Climb the flared, knobby, lichen covered (doesn\\'t pro real well) crack to its end and a 1/4\" bolt. If you have the luxury of an old, old Tuolumne guide book then you will see that it says to traverse right into a left facing corner, I instead headed straight up from the 1/4\" bolt on terrifying flaky way more runout slab climbing to the top.

With wandering approach pitches and some route-finding, this route will take longer than many similar length routes. Deflector shares short crack sections of Chartres, and if you want to top out on Medlicott Dome you'll have to climb the final pitch of Chartres (5.8 R, fragile/delicate knobs & flakes). Knobs, finger crack, lieback, steep edging, slab, gold polish edge incuts, flakes - lots of variety.    Currently the finger crack is somewhat vegetated, so beware you may need to clean a bit for the best pro. In wet years, this route will stay wet for a while in early season.

P1: Begin at a shallow, right-leaning, right-facing dihedral at the center of the wall, near a large pine.  Recent rockfall has made this pitch more difficult and more dangerous -- a stick clip for the first bolt is highly recommended.  Ascend this corner via smears and powerful liebacks until a stance at the anchor below a roof. 5.11b.    P2: Start P2 by going right, clip an old bolt and then hand traverse to the right. The route then traverses left to an arete-like feature formed by a shallow right-facing corner.  Climb this after clipping an oddly-placed bolt (consider backcleaning or a long runner) up to a poor stance under a roof.  Hand-traverse back right a few feet and pull through the roof on extremely powerful liebacks.  Good, small gear here.  Continue up to another bolted belay.  5.11b, crux.  It is possible to descend from here with two raps on a single 60m rope, but the third pitch should not be missed.  Bring a second rope in this case or be prepared to walk off.    P3: Climb a long, tricky, right-facing corner to the top.  5.10c.\",\n",

Pitch 2 - Traverse up and right to a short headwall with three bolts(crux) and arrive at a small ledge with two bolts.  You can belay here or continue up about 30-40 feet to a ledge with a gear belay and a bush/small tree.    Pitch 3 - Climb more or less straight up from the ledge with the bush/tree skirting several small overlaps to low angle slopes(5.5).    If you belayed on pitch 2 at the double bolts you might not make it to a gear belay at the top of the pitch.  There is a single 3/8\" bolt for a belay if you are out of rope. If you belayed on the ledge or have a long rope you can reach a gear belay where the climbing eases.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This easy pitch was originally part of an unfinished project. I drilled a 3/8\" hole for, at the time, the 3rd or 4th protection bolt. When I tried to hammer the bolt into the hole it would only go in part way. Hammering it further only caused the bolt to deform. I tightened the bolt down replaced my drill bit and continued the climb. After installing the next bolt I lowered down to the last and added another bolt several inches away with the intent of chopping the poor bolt later, when I had my patch kit. I lowered off the climb to continue it on another day. When I returned to the climb I found someone had connected the two bolts with webbing for an anchor. Later I heard that several people had enjoyed this fun easy bolted pitch. I decided to chop and patch the poor bolt and add another good bolt   and call it a pitch. I also added a couple of protection bolts making it  a less runout climb, a little better for a 5.7 leader.    The second pitch is unfinished.',\n",

You may choose to do this route in 4,5, or 6 pitches. Doing it in 4 requires a 70m rope or simul climbing 15' on the first and a bit on the last. The route starts out with enjoyable climbing, 5.6, following broken rock and cracks to a bolted station about 75' up. Belay here or continue up a left facing corner. Move out right at the end of the corner and follow discontinuous cracks and seams to an A shaped roof. Climb the right side of the A into a finger crack that ends at a comfy bolted belay. Get your stoppers ready, the next pitch likes to eat up small to medium size nuts, preferably offsets. Don't miss the sideways nut placement out on the face 35 or so feet up. I also find a spot for a pink tricam at mid height. The pitch finishes with friction climbing past 3 bolts to a 2 bolt belay/rap station. At this point the crux is 5.9 at most and takes great protection. But the next 2 pitches are much harder with a few  runout sections. The next pitch starts out with a short 5.11 section at the first bolt then gets much easier, though runout, passing three more bolts as you angle left to a 2 bolt anchor. The last pitch angles back right with several thin 5.10 moves, eventually ending at the last anchor on Stone Quest.\",\n",

It is mostly well protected, but it's no sport climb, with a few sporty sections. Getting to the first bolt on pitch 5 is heads up with ankle breaker potential. The sixth pitch is stellar, one of the best pitches at P-Line. There are several variations one can do for pitch one, other than the original described here.     P1 (10c/d) Horizontal Cracks Pitch . Climb past several horizontal cracks then up thin face move to a ledge. Clip anchor, jog left then back right and up to a bolt leading to  a nice splitter finger crack to a bolted belay/rap station.    P2 (5.10 move) In Your Face Traverse Pitch. This short pitch is mostly a class 2 traverse to get to pitch 3. You will be surprised by what appears to be a short 4th class section. from P1 anchor traverse 100' right to a 2 bolt belay.    P3 (10a) The Shiny Path of Hope Pitch. From the belay, face climb to and up a vertical crack. Then follow the shiny path of hope(several bolts) up to another bolted belay/rap   station.    P4 (5.9) Scary Giant Flake Pitch. Climb up to the left side of a large pillar following it to a nice ledge w/a bolted belay/rap station.    P5 (10b) Black Bolt of Death Pitch. From the top of the pillar traverse left to a bolt(don't fall here). Continue left to another bolt. Climb up and right to a black bolt then up to a bolted belay/rap station below a large flake.    P6 (11a) Undercling Pitch. This pitch is stellar. Bust out several thin friction moves working left and up to the large flake. undercling out right to the end of the flake then follow a few well spaced bolts to a 2 bolt belay/rap station.    P7 (10a) Backwards SSS Pitch. From pitch 6 belay, move up and right passing a couple of bolts. Then right to another bolt. Continue right to a flake bulge. Pull through the bulge, then follow bolts back left to a 2 bolt belay/rap station. Watch the rope drag on this pitch.    P8 easy to the top    Can rap the route w/1 60m rope. At the top of p3 swing climbers left to an alternate rap station.   \",\n",

       "  'description': \"So far there are 4 pitches to this route but the plan is to cotinue up another pitch or two. The first 2 are fairly easy and can be linked with a 60m rope. Climb the jumbled buttress right of the giant corner, 30' rigth of Simon the Dog, same start as Wretched in Stone, to a flat ledge. There are now bolts here. From the ledge work up and left into a big Chimney(Wretched in Stone). Once in the chimney keep your eye out for a bolt up and rigth. Climb to then past the bolt then move rigth to another bolt and continue right to a big ledge with a bolted anchor. P3 the fun begins, traverses right into an obvious left facing corner. The corner starts out wide (optional #5 Camalot) then turns to a #3Camolot size crack for a ways then narrows to tight hands and fingers. Before the crack ends step out of the corner to the rigth and clip a bolt that protects 5.10ish climbing into dicontinuous cracks that lead to a sloping ledge (#2Camolot here)and a bolted anchor a bit farther left. P4 moves right to a thin finger crack that angles sharply right. Follow the crack(very fun) to its end. From it's end climb past a bolt, a pin and two more bolts. The crux is at the last bolt. After passing the bolt sling a small horn and search for a gear placement to protect your second(I was able to get an ok offset nut and a red C3), before traversing right to the, for now, last bolted anchor. 2 rope rap down and right a bit to Tweet this, then 1 rope to the base of Tweet and another down or 2 ropes down. Fun to tr Tweet This.\",\n",

Although it stays wet for a few days after a rain you can almost always avoid the water. It has a fun traverse and a nice exposed belay.

       "  'description': \"This is a fun, albeit short, fist crack that is logistically a bit of a pain in the ass to climb. If you scramble to the right of Finger Lickin' you will see to large cracks/corners that face south. The right one is a chimney, and the left one is Pandora's Box.    Scramble down a brush filled gully (there is usually a fixed line here) until there is a short drop-off. You must find a place to belay here amongst the trees. The belayer will probably want an anchor. There is some easy hand-jamming to get up to the base of the fist crack. The crack starts out as #4 Camalots and narrows to 3's. Above is a slabby ledge that is capped by an overhang. The climb finishes out the left side of the overhang. There's some good pro here (small to fingers) and I had to stand in slings to get over the bulge (probably more like 5.10+ to free).    At the stance above I found a couple small hexes with some very tattered webbing. I added a large nut and got the whole rig equalized with some fresh cord and a locker, so the anchor should be bomber for a while but the soft materials will need to be replaced eventually. The guidebook also  shows the option of topping out and walking off, but who knows what kind of poison oak infested nightmare that would be.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This is a pretty unique route. The climbing and rock are pretty good in a few spots (and dirty in many others) but what really makes it worthwhile is the position. It climbs right along the lip of a really steep wall and, combined with the slab of the Cookie Sheet below, makes for a really exposed endeavor. There are some decent runouts on traversing terrain and routefinding issues to deal with.The cherry on top is the descent, unique in all the valley. Altogether, a great adventure  Here\\'s a thread with some more beta:   P1 - this is a total junker up through choss and dirt. Fire activity has mostly burned all the PO but has also made the soil very unstable. Anyway, aim up and right for a large, living pine tree. Pass this then head up and left through some mantles and bushes to the base of a nice handcrack  P2 - up the handcrack then step out on the slab to avoid bushes. pass an oak and belay near dead pine  P3 - locate the first bolt out right, climb past it, then keep going up and right passing one more bolt that protects a hard mantle move. I didn\\'t find any pins on this pitch. Belay at one bolt with a ring on it and small gear. There\\'s a 2 bolt anchor clearly seen out right that I think is the top anchor to \\'the higher truth\\' on the sugar cookie, but you don\\'t climb to it.  It sounds like many have bailed from this point, P4 looking a bit too gnarly. I think you could rap straight down and hit the anchor for 60/40 on the sugar cookie with one rope, but not 100% on that one. There is an easier variation to P4 that goes straight up. There is a bolt maybe 15 ft. up and bit left from the anchor. \"Afraid of the Edge\"  P4 - big exposure! the crux moves come pretty close to the belay so it may be better to have stronger partner follow. blowing it while following would result in a ride over the edge. there was nothing \"blind\" about the moves, imo, just a hard foot match. anyway, clip a bolt 15 ft. right of the belay, head up a corner, then traverse right to another bolt. easier and runout climbing leads up and right past one more bolt. I belayed on a clean slab with a horizontal crack for gear. They call this 5.8+... whatever... 5.9  P5 - head up the corner to get established on the upper slab, traverse straight right to a bolt and climb the arete on jugs. some more awesome exposure here. belay at some small, living pines.  P6 - this is kind of an unnerving pitch. head straight right, and even slightly down, to get established on the featured wall. follow the path of least resistance, mostly straight right. eventually, and hopefully, you will find a bolt. it\\'s kind of hidden but just keep looking. Then head up to some black rock and perform some awesome and big moves on good rock, protected by good gear in a horizontal. You may wish to stop and belay at the big pine above. Otherwise, keep heading right on the dirty ledge to a big flake  P7 - climb the big flake/crack that leads to the top.',\n",

Take Hwy 120 out of the Valley and after going through two short tunnels, park at a paved pullout immediately before the third, long tunnel.  Hike up the road to the mouth of this tunnel, jump over the stone wall, and follow a steep track down the cliff for 3 minutes.  This deposits you at the top of the Separate Reality visor.  Just before walking onto the slab, locate a good pine tree to fix a line to and do a short (40') rap down to a staging area at the base of the climb.      It's pretty obvious:  Climb the steep lieback flake to a stance, then bust out the 20' roof to a wild series of moves at the lip.\",\n",

This is understandable since Chicken Pie is one of the more demanding 5.9 finger to hand cracks.  The overall quality of this climb is comparable to the best cracks you will find down canyon.    Also, if you have repeatedly climbed pitch one of Chicken Pie, I would recommend you give the knobby pitch two top out a try.  From the chains, pitch two heads right and up large knobs.

An 80m rope might make it to the top of the cliff. I think with a 70m you will have to simulclimb 20ft or stop and belay at a hand crack just shy of the top.    Start a ways to the right off a boulder that touches the base of the wall. Climb up to a high first bolt, and then continue upwards to a second bolt. The bolts were recently replaced and are bomber. From the second bolt downclimb a short ways and traverse perhaps 15 feet to the left. From here continue up on smaller knobs to reach a small footledge below a water-streak. Down at the bottom of the footledge is a knob that you can tie off which protects the next crux. (It\\x92s also possible to escape here by traversing further left on big knobs to a bolted rap anchor) Make one sort of thin move above the ledge to gain a good rail and bigger knobs in the water-streak. There is another \\x91ok\\x92 knob that can be tied off here, before you must mantel onto a hummock which is growing out of the bottom of a flake. This leads to directly below the roof where there is good gear (1\\x94-1.5\\x94 cams). Getting over the roof is easy thanks to big knobs and then it\\x92s a cruise to the top of the cliff.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is what it\\'s all about, pitch after pitch of demanding, ultra high quality climbing on excellent stone w/ a surpassing view.  Almost all the pitches would be highly sought after if they were base routes and three or four would be mega classics.  If you don\\'t think this climb is great, either you\\'re just being contrary or you need to find another sport.    Bibliographic Note 1: SuperTopo.com has an excellent free topo download for this climb that most will find more useful than the following route description:       Bibliographic Note 2: An old issue Rock and Ice (from the 80s) had an article by Bob Yoho providing the pitch by pitch \"betamax\" - move by move sequences for all the cruxes -- on this route.  This is amusing to look at after you do the climb, but it will probably just confuse you beforehand.    Approach: Walk east from the Awahnee on a road for about 15 minutes until you encounter a climber\\'s trail on the left which heads up to Column.  The climber\\'s trail can be hard to spot in low light, so if you\\'re getting an early start, it\\'s worth scoping out at least this much of the approach beforehand.  The climber\\'s trail continues past the start of AM which is more or less directly below the obvious right-facing enduro corner. After leaving the main climber\\'s trail, scramble up ledges to a small ledge with a tree which is where the climb starts.  Without routefinding errors, the approach can be done in an easy 45 minutes.    P1: Trend up and right on easy vegetated ground for about 100\\' to a ledge with anchors.  This bushy pitch can be wet and unpleasant in spring.  It makes sense to skip this belay and continue up a right facing layback w/ finger jams (short stretch of 10a) on steeper, nicer rock for about another 50 feet to another set of anchors; if you plan on doing the easier version of the next pitch, belay here, otherwise traverse left 20\\' and belay at the base of a thin crack.  10a 170-190\\'    P2: The Boulder Problem.   Option 1 the traditional Boulder Problem:  From the left end of the ledge, climb up a thin crack, fiddle in some small nuts, bust some fingery, feetless, old school 11c moves (the technical crux of the route), reach a ledge/flake and traverse right 20, then up another 20\\'of ~5.9 layback jamming to a small, sloping ledge w/ fixed anchors.   Option 2, easier, more direct, less well protected.  This variation goes straight up, avoiding the two traverses.  Historically, the route did not go this way because it was harder to protect but with modern small cams (~blue Alien) it is safe.   The climbing is thin laybacking/face climbing.  ST rates it 10a but 10d is more like it.  The need to hang out and place gear adds some difficulty.  After you make it through the crux first 10\\', you encounter a ramp with a crack in it.  Be forewarned, this may be covered in dirt, exasperating when you are desperately trying to plug a unit (~ red Alien).  Above this point, the two options merge.    I will blasphemously recommend option two, skipping the boulder problem, as the more direct, in character with the rest of the climbing, momentum preserving way.  Note: Dean Potter caught some grief when he took the piker\\'s variant during his solo of AM, so if you\\'ve got hardass friends or are in the limelight, you might want to \"bear down\" and go the hard way.    Note 2: Either way, this is a quality pitch.    Pitch 3: The Enduro Corner.  Totally classic, an endless Indian Creek style, continuous corner which favors those with smaller hands.  Starts out with 2.5 Friends and gradually thins.  Keep you eye out for the occasional bomber handjam and stem rest.  Towards the top, the corner thins more (1.5 Friend) and most people go from jamming laybacks to straight laybacking.  This point is probably the crux of the pitch and ends with a thank god sinker hand jam.  The last 40\\' of the pitch are 5.7 chimney in which it is nice to have a 4 Friend or Camalot.  Belay at the second set of anchors, on a big ledge.  11c 165\\'.   If you rap from here, you\\'ve done Astroboy.    P4.  One of two \"easy\" pitches on the climb.  Head up and left in an easy, blocky corner system for maybe 20\\'until you hit an cruiser handcrack which is followed to a small stance in a flare with bolted anchors.  5.9 80\\'.    P5.  Another great one, reminiscent of the Rostrum.  Follow a wide hands corner crack for about 1/2 a rope length until encountering a roof;  the trick on this pitch in rationing and/or walking your bigger gear through this section.  From the roof, reach left to a thin crack system, finagle in some small gear (RPs, purple Alien) then step over to this crack and follow it up ( 10c layback & face climbing, occasional small nut) until you can reach back right where the crack is easier and followed to another bolted anchor ledge beneath the ominous, impending maw of The Slot.  10c, 130\\'.       P6. The Harding Slot.  Competitor of the Hollow Flake for THE imagination seizing Valley pitch.  Many strong climbers have melted down here.  There are a couple of reasons for this: first, it requires a style of climbing that is rarely encountered outside of the Valley and avoided in general and second, most average and large size people don\\'t believe they can fit through the slot.  (This is a great pitch to be small on.)     At any rate, from the belay crank up on straight forward 10+/11- laybacking for about 25\\' until a stance.  Place some #1 Friend size gear (BETA ALERT: there is an obvious 1.5 Friend placement here -- don\\'t fill it up w/ gear.)  Once you\\'ve got bomber gear, make a plan and execute.  The next 6 or 7 feet can be both baffling and exhausting.  You\\'re working with very thin hands (for only one hand!) in a slick, smooth flare that\\'s not quite a chimney and not quite a corner.  ST indicates a \"dyno chicken wing\" is the secret here;  I say nonsense -- that\\'s the sort of inscrutable beta that\\'s likely to leave have you hanging on the rope, thinking about rap anchors.   So somehow you\\'ve passed the entry move, and you\\'re standing on a small ledge, still able to move your head.  You\\'re officially in the slot.  Make sure there\\'s nothing on the back of your harness (you should have lengthened your knot at the belay and left your helmet on the ground) and start squirming.  They say take an \\'S\\' path but it\\'s not like you could move otherwise.  Stay calm and settle for an inch at a time progress.  The entire slot itself is about 20-25\\' long and the really narrow part 10-15\\'.  There is gear to be had in the back of the slot but don\\'t place it unless you have it in for your second; anyhow, it would be pretty hard to fall -- if you slipped, you\\'d quickly wedge.   For those absolutely too large to squeeze through, there is an alternative, laybacking the outside of slot, supposedly 11 X.  (I question the X as I\\'ve heard a fairly reliable story of a guy going this way and taking the fall unscathed three times before he finally made it through.)  I\\'ve belayed a 2nd taking this outside route and it seemed horrendous -- if possible, any members of your party who have to go this way should be following.    The Slot is the key to route.  Be ready for it which means having someone who can lead 5.10 squeeze and get through the baffling entry moves.  Some parties which had been cruising up to that point bail after being stymied by the entry moves.  There are some great pitches above the slot and just because one move is giving you fits is no reason not to experience them; if need be, aid a couple moves and press on.   11b, 60\\'.    Note: you probably started the slot in the sun and ended in the shade.  Plan accordingly.    You\\'re now at the point of no return.  The ledge at the end of slot is the last with bolted anchors and the last place you could reasonably retreat from.    P7.  Hands around a roof (10b), then some 5.9ish hands brings you to a spot where the traditional route goes left at 11b and the pikers var. right at 10c.  The 11b way is better (technical face/stem move with good gear) but if your tank is running low, discretion might be the better part of valor.  More quality 5.9 cracking takes you to a good ledge where you\\'ll actually have to rig your own belay.  11b/10c 150\\'.    P8.  Changing corners.  Fantastic.  20 or 30\\' of easy ground bring you to mantle (11a) which is one of those moves that you can sail through one time only to flail the next time.  There is an old, questionable bolt here which can be backed up w/ something like a yellow Alien; if you\\'re really motivated top rope pro (#2 Rock?) can be had.  After the mantle, some more easy ground takes you to the base of the corner, right-facing at this point, which is ascended until things get too hard and you step left around the arete onto slabby face which is followed for a few feet until you start wondering about your last pro, out of sight, below you around the arete.  BETA ALERT: reach blindly back right and place something (2 Friend, 1 Camalot?) in the original corner.  Eventually you rejoin the corner, now facing left, for a long stretch of fingerlocks and stemming (small nuts).  (The face passage is sensational but can be avoided by staying in the corner (11d, better gear)).  After the corner ends, continue in easier, wider cracks (good to have a 3 Camalot and a 4 Friend) until a stance in the vicinity of a couple of fixed pins.  There are several belay options before this point but its good to stretch it to here in order to be able to link the next two pitches. 11b 150\\'.     P9:  Blast through a long stretch of 10- which trends right.  Then up 50\\' of 5.9 cups and fists (#3 through #4 Camalot, easy to walk).  At the end of this crack, step right and hand traverse right to the left end of a long ledge and set up a belay.  This may be a really good pitch, but at this point you\\'re probably too sated to really appreciate it.  10a, 200\\'.    Move the belay to the right end of the ledge.    P10.  The scary face pitch.  Not the best pitch on the route, but as the sting in the tail, essential to the experience.  The nature of the rock changes from classic Valley granite to something less desirable.  Up an easy corner for about 20\\'.  Then a reachy 10+ move with decent protection including an extruding angle that makes a good foothold (shame); ST gives this section an R but it seemed pretty well protected to me.  Up a few easier face moves, taking whatever gear you can get, and establish yourself at the base of a thin, downward pointing flake.  You can get ostensibly decent gear at the bottom of the flake (red RP, blue Alien) but the flake is expanding, so this gear probably isn\\'t worth much.  If you\\'re lucky, there may be some fixed heads within reach to the left.  Whatever the case, sack up, commit to sending and work up the flake (10b) which gradually gets easier but doesn\\'t offer pro for at least 20\\'; if you blew it in this section, it is possible you\\'d zipper all the way down  to a menacing spike at the start of the difficulties.  At any rate, you succeed, place a 1.5 Friend size piece (phew!) and romp up easier ground to a ledgey area.  10d, 100+\\'.    50\\' of 4th class up and right leads to the top of the column.    Descent: follow a rough trail, north for a short while and then east for much longer, with the occasional class three or four section.  This will eventually feed you into slabs which are tediously descended (class two to four, possibly complicated by wet streaks) until you eventually can walk back west towards the column and find the trail to your packs and the bottom.  The full descent from the top of the column to the valley floor will take two to three hours and would be quite sketchy in the dark.  I don\\'t remember much more about the descent but it would probably be well advised to consult SuperTopo or some other authoritative reference before embarking on it for the first time.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Direct Route on Washington Column is an old classic climb that used to extremely popular until it became forgotten as more (better) climbs became discovered. The first half climbs the original route to Lunch Ledge which was the first technical climbing route done in the Valley by legends Harvey Voge, Richard Leonard, Jules Eichorn and Bestor Robinson in 1933. The Direct Route continues up from Lunch Ledge to the summit via chimneys.     It doesn\\'t ring true anymore but Roper summed it up in the old 1971 Green Valley Guide by saying, \"Although not terribly enjoyable or aesthetic, this route is probably done by most climbers who stay in the Valley for any length of time.\" Not as clean or classic as the Royal Arches, the Direct Route is a step up in difficulty but is fun enough with cool history that it deserves to be done at least once in every Yosemite climber\\'s tenure. If nothing else it\\'s a great moderate adventure climb to pass a day in the shade for most of the route if starting early.       Approach up to the base of the Column and follow it left towards the huge gully separating the Column from the Arches wall. After passing the gully on the right, take 3rd classes ledges up and right to the base of the first pitch.     NOTE: This description assumes you are climbing with a 70m rope and dont mind a few short simul climbing sections off the anchors. Otherwise it\\'s very easy to belay almost anywhere if using a 60m.     There are many fixed pins on this route, which doesn\\'t always mean you are ON route, but generally, if you see them, you\\'re going the right way.     P.1 (5.7) Off the belay, down climb about 25 ft. until able to start moving up the obvious corner right, past a bush, to a small ledge with an old tat anchor. From the anchor, cross around right into 5.7 face on gritty rock passing a tree to the left and up the corner past another old bolt anchor. Make sure to resist cutting too far right. Continue straight up and eventually trend right up small ledges passing a final third bolt anchor to belay on a ledge at a huge pine tree. 230 ft.    P.2 (5.9) At the tree is the base of a short 5.9 corner. Climb up about 30 ft until able to cut out left on the face to get into an easier corner, following many fixed pins, up and right until you reach a nice ledge with a big pine tree and a distinct tree with three trunks. 220 ft.     P.3 (5.8) From the ledge, climb up a small boulder and continue straight up easy climbing past more trees and pins until reaching a small ledge with a fixed pin on the wall. A short 5.7 \"mantel\" move left with a high step onto the next ledge and then traverse past an old bolted anchor to the base of the Reigelhuth \"Chimney\" with a bolt about 10ft. up. More of a hand crack than chimney, one wide move leads to easier climbing up to Lunch Ledge. As one of the most famous ledges in the Valley, it\\'s quite underwhelming. 240 ft. with some simul climbing off the anchor. If using a 60m belay at the bolt anchor below the Reigelhuth Chimney.     P.4 (5.8) From Lunch Ledge you choose to either climb the \"Fat Man Chimney\" or the \"Charlie Brown Chimney\". Fat Man is easier with better protection and fixed pins while Charlie Brown is harder and more run out. Charlie Brown will lure you from Lunch Ledge with a deceptively easy and cleaner beginning to the right but don\\'t be tempted! (Unless you\\'re psyched) For Fat Man, continue straight up passing a small tree to the left and up crumbly 5.7 face along the corner that turns into the Fat Man Chimney. Pass two old bolts and pins until continuing up a hand crack after the chimney up and right, passing a tree, to the anchor. 215 ft.    P.5 (5.9) From the anchor climb up and right around the arete over a small step to easy 5.6 face reaching a short 5.9 insecure corner section. At the top walk up sandy ledges for 100 ft. until reaching a ledge with a huge tree at the base of the Great Chimney. 200 ft. Also possible to continue 25 ft higher to the actual base of the chimney and link both chimney pitches into one with a 70m rope.     P.6 (5.8) Start off with old school 5.8 wide chimney moves past a piton. Climb over 3 large chock stones until reaching the usual midway belay ledge with bushes. If using a 60m stop here and belay. Otherwise, continue up past pins to another large chock stone and up until reaching a ledge with a huge pine tree. 250 ft from lower tree belay, 220 ft. from base of chimney.     P.7 (5.7) Climb up an easy chimney section to another small ledge. Instead of continuing straight up to harder climbing cut left behing the big corner to easier climbing. Continue up until eventually tunneling under a huge car sized boulder and up to the belay ledges. 200 ft.     P.8 (5.10a or 5.9 var.) From here there are a lot of options and it is confusing to find anything familiar. Stay left and up for easy scrambling exit pitches or move the belay up and over right for about 200 ft. until at the base of a corner with a large white flake on the ground. From the flake, climb up a glory 2\" hand crack to a small roof. At the roof cut right on a 5.7 hand traverse to either continue right and up on the variation (slightly easier) or back up and left of the roof to a midway belay ledge with a tree. If using a 60m belay here. Continue up the 5.9 corner with quickly degrading rock to one last 5.10a move from under the roof and up onto the summit slab.     From the summit continue up sandy slopes to the summit of the Column and take the North Dome Descent Gully down.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Crest Jewel is a fantastic high-elevation slab climb; perhaps the best in the country.  Certainly the best I've done in Colorado or California.  If you only ever do one long slab climb, this should be it.      The climb is fairly well-bolted (entirely with modern hardware and safe belays), but expect typical run outs on the easier terrain (5.8 and below).  These generally feel less and less scary  later in the route as you become accustomed to the style.  The crux, if doing Crest Jewel Direct, comes early and is very well protected.      I'm not going to give a pitch-by-pitch description of the climb, but it would behoove parties who haven't done the climb before to have a photocopy of the topo with them -- if only to figure out which general direction to head off in when departing a belay -- often the next protection bolt is hard to spot and the climbing could conceivably go anywhere.    The original Crest Jewel accesses the wall from the left side at about one-third height, whereas Direct begins at a high-point at the base of the dome, also towards the left margin of the main face.  Direct intersects that first pitch of the original route after five pitches of harder slab climbing.  Most parties approach via Royal Arches which makes for a  very full 30-pitch day.    The route gets sun all day long and can really cook up there, but the wind can also pick up making things quite unpleasant.  Views of the Valley and Half Dome in particular are outstanding.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This route is surprisingly good.  Reid\\x92s book only gives it one star, but most people who have climbed it consider a hidden gem.  You\\x92ll encounter solid rock decorated with slabs, face, cracks, corners, chimneys, no fixed gear, exposure and amazing views of Half Dome the entire way.  Although rated 5.7 there are some thought proving sections.  Personally, I felt that the 5.7 rating was a sandbag and you could easily argue that some sections are closer to 5.9.  Climb it for yourself and decide.  Linking this with Royal Arches will give you 23 pitches of trad climbing in one day.  It is hard to beat that.    P1: Up the slabs (5.6R) to a crack.  Take the crack to tree with slings.  160\\x92    P2: Go up and right into the corner (5.5) and belay about 50\\x92 below slings that are hanging high up in the corner.  These slings are off route. 100\\x92    P3: Probably the crux of the route (5.7 sandbag).  Again, do not go to the slings in the corner as they are not part of this route.  Continue up the corner a little ways until you see a ledge that goes right and around the dihedral.  There is a large hole with an undercling in it.  The problem to figure out is how to get your foot in the hole while using the undercling that will be at your feet.  There is pro before the move that you need to add a sling to in order to avoid rope drag.  Consequently, if you fall you will likely hit the slabs below.  All the moves are there once you commit to it.  Continue traversing the face (stopping to admire Half Dome) until you reach a shallow crack.  Head up the crack to a bush and set up a belay.  160\\x92    P4: Up the crack (5.7) with a little bit of face climbing (5.6) near the top.  Belay below the chimney at a ledge. 165\\x92    P5: Maybe the best pitch on the route.  Up the chimney (5.7) with right side in so that you can use holds on the outside of the chimney to help you advance. When the chimney pinches down head out and then up an amazing perfect low angle splitter hand crack (5.6) in a right facing dihedral.  At the top you will encounter some bushes.  Break left and set up a belay, again at the bottom of the dihedral. 160\\x92    P6. A little bit of chimney then up and right into the corner with the splitter 1\\x94 crack (5.7).  Layback this low angle crack until you\\x92re almost out of rope and set up a hanging belay. 190\\x92. You could also stop lower at a better belay stance.  However this will likely add another pitch to the climb.    P7. Continue up a bit more of the layback. Two options now exist.  Option A (5.9R): Go up the crack until it ends, place a few piece of pro (small cam and med nut) then run it out up progressively easier slab climbing.  The harder moves are with in 10\\x92 of the pro.  Option B (5.7): go right along a small roof until it ends then go up.  I did not do this option, but it probably the original line.  Either way head up the summit slabs as far as you can until you find a suitable belay. 100\\x92    North Dome Gully Descent:  Walk north along the top of the dome looking for a trail that eventually heads west.  Follow this trail down hill heading slightly away from the dome.  If you lose the trail (which I found likely) you will have serious bush whacking good times.  Eventually break east crossing the slabs that were seen during the approach.  Continue down the slabs until you reach the trail on top of Royal Arches.  Follow this trail east going up and over Washington\\x92s Column.  At one point you will have an easy class 2 descent on a sandy 2 foot ledge with a significant drop to the right.  Soon after, the trail seems to dead end.  If you\\x92ve reached this point, back track a little.  Go up hill a bit and cross a steep slope.  Continue east for another half mile to a mile.  Looking to the right you will eventually see the decent through the sandy boulder field.  Follow this down to the valley floor.  One of the major problems I found with this decent are the numerous trails that begin and end.  From the top of North Dome to the Valley floor is likely 4 hours for someone who has not done the decent before.  Here are a few tips to help you through this.  First, keep in mind that there are no rappels necessary, so if you are thinking about setting one up just keep on going. Secondly, if you go to the east side of Glacier Point Apron (near Grack) and look across you should see the decent.  This will help you understand how far from Washington\\x92s Column the gully is.  Lastly, doing this in the dark in for the first time could have some serious negative side effects.  I saw several bivy sites on top of Washington\\x92s Column that are likely from climbers who have decided to wait until morning before heading down.  If in doubt, pack a space blanket,lighter to start a fire and hunker down.   ',\n",

Up to this point Reid topo was fine. But P6 left me in doubt what we did. From belay directly above was dirty mossy corner with no pro which possible was the route Donini climbed  40 years ago. At the same time clean wide crack leaning 45 degree toward right from belay  and looks well protectable , but very hard. And it was no way 5.10. Than it goes vertical  hard double crack with some hand jams. We call it second crux 5.11. 80ft.   Edit: my theory that some big blocks of rock fell near the top of p5/ beginning of p6, since 1972  FFA.  This made transition to 5.9/5.10 chimney impossible leaving only the choice of 5.11 wide crack leaning  toward right from the top of p5.     P7. You have the choice to climb left chimney or right chimney. Topo did not help to make the choice. We climbed right chimney and still not sure did we make correct choice or not. 160 ft, 5.8.   [Edit] After reading Christina TR where they ended up at the same dead end as we did- I think Left Chimney should be taken which make an easier way to the top of Dome.    Climbing eased up   couple more pitches to reach the top of Basket Dome following crack system.  We reached dead end on our way, down climb, transitioned left to other crack system and finally reached the top of the Dome    The route has no bolts, no pitons, no slings- nothing can imply that anyone climbed it before you. At the same time most of the pitches have superb quality, but with some dust and  dirt falling in your face if you looking up watching your partner.

Clip one of the first two bolts on the ladder for security and use chimney technique to ascend directly below the chockblock.  Place a bomber small to medium cam with a long runner and pull the strenuous old school 5.8 moves to gain the slopped and sandy top of the chockblock.  Set up a belay in the tree/bushes further above the chockblock.    Pitch 2)  Bump the belay up to an alcove at the highest point of the slopped and sandy ledge.   Climb a hollow stack of blocks (5.5) until a bush with years of broken sticks and sediment blocks your progress.  Find a passage through the bush and debris.  Set up a belay on top of the debris at the base of a dark and intimidating chimney.    Pitch 3)  Easily begin up the chimney setting questionable pro until a good rest is reached below an impasse.  Slowly stem toward the outside of the chimney to eventually regain upward progress (5.7).  Climb up the narrowing and increasingly rotten chimney.  Stay on route here and do not escape toward Tithe.    When you reach the top of the climb, find a large pine tree with slings and biners for the start of the rappels.  Make one double rope rappel to the sandy/sloped top of pitch one.  Find a ledge that traverses over the top of pitch one, looking for a rappel anchor that consists of a rusty quarter inch bolt and an old stopper.  Make a single rope rappel from the bolt/stopper anchor back to the start of the climb.',\n",

Clip an anchor, and then perform a difficult 5.11a traverse right.  Climb up past bolts to a ledge with a small tree (visable from the base).  Belay.  5.11a.    P2:  The crux.  Head up the thin, sustained face above.  5.11c.  Traverse right to a belay in a right facing corner/ramp.    P3:  Head up the ramp past bolts, then up a crack to a roof.  Pull the roof to the right, and continue up to a belay.  5.11b.    P4.  Pumpy, but easier than pitch two.  Climb up the overhanging crack system past bolts.  Traverse left on steeper rock, and then more easily up to a belay.  5.11c.    Rap the route with a single 60m rope.\",\n",

The climb tackles the attractive arete just left of The Great Escape.    P1:  Begin on a large ledge and climb up past 2 bolts.  From here, either head up the mungy corner at 5.10 armed with a few stoppers, or bust left to the bolted arete, also mungy.  One really hard move.  5.12b, 80'.    P2:  Face climb up off the belay with really interesting moves -- probably the best pitch.  5.11d, 80'.    P3:  Continue up the arete, past a great, difficult sequence and immediately into a slabby boulder problem crux.  Continue to the highest of two belay ledges (and three sets of anchors).  5.12b, 80'.    P4:  Move out onto the right hand face and climb up and into a small corner.  Either stop here at chains, or link into the next pitch -- up and left along a diagonal weakness.  5.11d, 80'-160'.    Rap with one 60m rope.    Rest in peace, Jeff.\",\n",

It can be used to approach/descend routes on Grizzly Peak, and it is also the most direct approach to the southwest shoulder of Half Dome (although it's only the fastest approach to Snake Dike, et al, if you know what you're doing and are a fast bushwhacker)    The start of the gully is basically straight above Happy Isles. If you're walking on the path along the road, you'll cross the river and then the JMT/Mist trail leaves the road and heads off to the right (south). From the bridge, follow the trail for 200ft or so and then turn left and head straight uphill (east) through the forest.    Hopefully you'll start following a faint drainage and then end up at the bottom of a 35ft water-polished gully which looks like this:       This is the only section of 4th class on the route, and it's pretty easy (especially going up). Most of the rest of the way involves zig zagging on ledges. There's a steep narrow 5th class gully off to the left which is off-route. Nothing should be exposed and some of the key bits of 3rd class scrambling should look somewhat well-traveled. The bushwhacking should also be pretty minimal. In the upper 3rd, the route begins to actually resemble a gully again with some 3rd class slabs and steep dirt/grass. Then the gully splits. I think either way goes, but I've only been down the south fork (that's climber's right).    From the notch it's 3rd class to the summit of Grizzly Peak. Avoid some steep sections by staying on the left (south side) of the ridge.    If descending the gully just read the description in reverse. In general I found it worked pretty well to stay to the right (out away from the trees/bushes) until I'd get cliffed-out, then cut back left to find an easy way down to the next tier.\",\n",

Walk just a little bit further and you will see an interpretive sign about \"Rock Piles\". Scramble up the talus just to the left of the sign until you find the old Sierra Point trail. It\\'s still a fairly popular hike and the path should be well-worn and easy to follow.    From Sierra Point ascend the brushy ledges along the ridge. After a couple minutes you will need to make a short downclimb to the right, then climb back out to the right on a thin crack in a corner. More ledges lead to the first \"step\" on the ridge.    Next you will encounter a prominent rib of 5th class rock. Ledges lead around to the right side of this, but they cliff out under some overhangs. Instead traverse on the left side of the ridge where the rock is slabbier. Eventually you will head up a corner/gully back onto the ridge proper. Then make an exposed step left into a chimney and tunnel through and up to more ledges.    That\\'s it for the 4th class and exposure. The rest of the way to the summit is an unenjoyable bushwhack. Sign the summit register.    The easiest descent is to downclimb the notch route (class 3). Hike down the east ridge towards the notch. Stay to the right (south) side of the ridge whenever necessary. A couple short and unexposed downclimbs are all that\\'s needed to reach the notch. From there you can descend the LeConte Gully back to the Valley floor, or bushwhack onwards to Half Dome, Broderick, ect...',\n",

       "  'description': \"Mahtah is an amazing route that should be considered on par with some of the better long sustained 5.12 crack climbs in the country. It has very little wide climbing, and lots of pumpy endurance climbing and traversing, with no singular bouldery problem or sequence harder than V4/V5. The rock quality is excellent.  The climb follows several long right-facing corners, with a few memorable roof encounters, some splitters, and a 45m traverse pitch to connect major crack systems into a free route. The setting above Nevada Falls and perched above the main Yosemite Valley is scenic, and the walkoff descent is casual.The overall difficulty is needing the fitness for completing similarly demanding endurance pitches stacked together, along with the technique for some slabbier bits. Most people will find P5 (sustained 5.12, pumpy gear and maybe a bit grassy) or P6 (shorter with straightforward burl) to be the crux pitch. The FFA team left the grade a bit open ended in the AAJ, suggesting 80s 5.12b to 5.13- for the overall.  This route combines sections of the aid routes SW Face, Direct SW Face, and Bad Moon Rising, but doesn't rely on much fixed aid gear. The attached topo is all you really need, go have fun!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Scarface now goes both free and clean. This route starts with a few hundred feet of dirty cracks before entering the clean white granite of the rock scar. The difficulty of this routes lies in the two 5.12 crux pitches, P5 and P8. The rest of the route is in the 5.10 to 5.11- range and climbs quite quickly.    If the first few pitches clean up more this has the potential to be a great route. As it stands expect a little bit of foliage at the start and on the last pitch.  All belays up to P9 have bolts or are at trees with rappel slings. This would still be a very fun outing at 5.11a C2 and could be done in a day.      From the ground climb up a series of dirty ledges and step left to short corner. Stem and layback up until you can move left to the base of a thin crack. Climb the thin crack, passing a bolt and get established in a slabby corner. A few hard moves getting to, and working past another bolt lead to an exciting stemming sequence and a belay at a tree on the left.    This pitch is often dirty and can be wet in the early spring. Having a nut tool to clean out the crack is a plus. The stances are pretty good, so you cleaning on the go doesn\\'t add much difficulty.      From the belay work up to the right and start climbing the long and  varied corner. A crux comes pretty early getting past a bulge. Midway up the pitch you will mantel up onto a dirty ledge with a pink rope setup as a rap station, keep climbing!    The endless layback resumes with nice finger slots and a few bushes.  Make a few hard moves to get through a short chimney section and a nice rest out right. Romp up the final crack, with some more fun laybacking! Belay at a good stance at the tree with a green rappel sling.      This is the cleanest of the first three pitches. Start off with a few tricky layback moves or stem up using the large dead tree as a foot hold. Crisp finger locks lead you out right to yet another section of slopey layback (hopefully you\\'ve got it dialed by now). Punch it until the edge of the crack gets better and figure out how to get yourself standing on the chalkstone. A couple more tricky moves get you to a grove of trees. Sling something for pro and do some easy (5.7/5.8) but unprotected face climbing on the wall to the right of the trees to get established on a big, and often sunny, ledge. Belay at two bolts.      The climbing is never particularly run out, but there are occasional places where there is loose rock and one spot with bad fall potential, thus the R rating. The climbing on the \"R\" section is not much harder than 5.8/5.9, just be careful with rock quality.    Start just to the right of the bolted belay with thin gear and a few mantels. Some tricky stemming gets you established on a wide ledge. Go right and up through some chossy rock to get established in an awesome left leaning hand crack. When the crack ends step to the right avoiding the ledge covered in loose rock. Some thin gear protects tricky moves to get into a chossy hand crack. Fun crack and face moves over a series of blocks lead to a two bolt belay on a nice 3\\' x 5\\' ledge.         The first of many stellar pitches. From the belay you can either face climb straight up past two bolts or use the wide crack out left. In both cases be careful to avoid the precarious stacked blocks above the wide crack. Traverse across the grainy rail until you reach a no-hands stance.  Face climb/layback up a semi-expando flake with good gear out left. Mantel up on the block/feature above you which provides a nice no hands rest. Clip a bolt and check out the tricky traverse to the leaning crack.    Bust out a short crimpy boulder problem, 5.11, and make a few hard moves up the crack to get established on a foot rail. Recovery is key since the next ten feet are tips! Red C3 fits best since green aliens are too big. The crack is quite off-set so heel hooks and tricky foot work are possible. Once you pass the small bush, the crack changes corners again and gets steeper. It quickly goes to rattly fingers (.5 camalots) and the feet disappear. Luckily the crack is pretty sharp and you can get opposition with your thumb. Fight your way up the leaning crack until a hand jam pod, where you can catch a rest.    The crack thins back down to fingers, but by now you should be quite pumped and wishing a good foot would magically appear. After a few moves your prayer is answered in the way of a thin hand jam and the notion that you have almost done it. Grr your way up a few more fingerlocks and until you can reach a hand crack that takes you the rest of the way to the anchor. Belay at two bolts on a small ledge and enjoy the pump that goes all the way to the bone.         Start off with enjoyable thin hands off the belay until you must switch to the left crack. Climb up the grainy rock on your left which goes from  thin hands to hands. Catch a rest, clip a bolt and navigate over some scary stacked blocks. Despite the detached appearance the blocks stay in place and you are soon greeted with a splitter wide crack. Fist jam up clean granite making sure to bump along your #4 camalot. Eventually difficulty eases and you get a rest on a short slab. Another #4 camalot can go in here or you can run it out until you can place a finger sized piece in a thin crack on the left. Dual cracks lead up with plentiful gear options until you pass another wide section of crack. Laybacking seems to be the best option here and eventually the crack thins to nothing. Make a hero reach from the last finger lock to a perfect jug.  A few easy moves leads to a two bolt anchor on a reasonable ledge.      Start climbing up the wide crack until you can see a line of three bolts with black hangers. The original line continues further up the wide crack  before cutting left on a ladder with mix of rivets and 1/4 inch bolts. The free line joins the aid ladder at the last bolt (which was upgraded to 3/8\").    Climb a series of small ledges angling up and to the left past the three bolts. A combination of mantels and  trickery will get you to the highest foot rail. Make a long reach to clip a bolt and get established on the slab. The holds get progressively better and you work back to the right to another bolt (which is the end of the aid ladder). From here follow the bottom of a flake to the left via underclings. Gear in a crack to the right can protect the crux  reach to thin seams/crimps on the face.  The flake you are climbing gets steeper and eventually a series of good fingerlocks leads to a two bolt belay at hanging stance. The belay is more comfortable if you throw a finger sized piece or nut in the crack to your right.         Steep fingerlocks off the belay lead to a tricky bulge and a good stance. Continue layabacking up the stellar corner passing an occasional section of rattly  fingers. Make sure to milk the rests before the crack runs out and there is a bolt. Execute a cruxy reach to good hold on the face, or do some ninja stemming. Clip a second bolt, and boulder up on face holds. Once you get your feet situated you can reach left to a flake system which will take you back into the main corner. When the corner crack pinches out make use of the thin finger crack on the left and execute a final tricky sequence. Move carefully past a loose tooth and traverse right to a nice sloping ledge with two bolts.      From the belay work up the thin corner until you can clip a bolt on the left wall. Balance/slab climb with difficulty, until you can make use of a thin crack on the left wall. Follow this as it becomes a finger crack and then pinches out. A few tricky moves are required before you can reach the next section of finger crack. Keep stemming up the golden rock until you can move left. Easy terrain leads to a belay on a sloping ledge with two bolts.         From the belay climb the dirty wide hands crack until you get to a loose block. Step left and climb up to the obvious left leaning roof. Climb this, extending all your pieces, and pull around past a small stump. Layback and jam up an easy crack until you can reach a dirty ledge. Reach high for a small flake and make a committing move on to the face. Follow the seam to an obvious wide pod, which takes a #3 camalot. Continue up the seam at 5.10 until you reach a ledge covered in manzanita.  Continue straight up various low angle cracks and aim for a shiny bolt.  Climb on the right side of the bolt slicky stemming up to a good rail. A few more easy moves lead to a ledge.   Belay to the right of a tree with red bark on a ledge with hand sized gear in a flake. This is about 20\\' above the bolt .      Climb up past a few loose block  until you can step left towards a \"chimney\". Find a thin flake on the right which becomes a fun hand crack. When the flake pinches out step left to an obvious crack in a corner. Undercling across a small roof and gas it past  a tricky section. Face climb up to the right, past occasional cracks towards a clump of manzanita bushes. Pass the bushes on the right side to access a small ledge with a large tree on the right.  Belay here.      From the belay trend left along a nice low angle crack system. After about 40 feet the crack pitches out and you will need to step left to a hidden flake, follow this up passing a short roof and head towards some small trees.  Follow the past of least resistance as you head towards the summit. It seems best to follow the left leaning  gully/crack system towards a large tree. This pitch is low angle and has some moss and sand, tread carefully.    Belay at bigest tree you can reach at the end of your rope.    There is still about 200-300 feet of easy scrambling to the summit. It is best to un-rope at the big tree and walk up the manzanita and slabs in your approach shoes.',\n",

A better route is to climb more or less straight up above the brushy ledge. The 5.9 is found on a friction face several pitches above the ledge. Descend via brush-filled slopes to the west.\"  The face is somewhat wide, and no description of the pitches reaching the brushy ledge is known, but the lower face is low angle and looks fairly featured. It is also unknown where on the face the upper pitches start, but there appears to be a corner near the junction of the south and east faces.',\n",

The grades listed below are my best guess and are not meant to sandbag anyone.  I believe these are the honest grades that consensus will reach as the route sees more traffic.    Pitch 1 - 5.10 - 160 feet     Start up a thin dihedral with a bush at the start, then out or around a small A-frame roof to another dihedral with thin to good fingers to a 2 bolt belay (only bolted belay on the climb).    Pitch 2 - 5.11+, 150 feet - 4 bolts     Traverse up and right to a bolt then continues right to a crumbly corner (5.7), then to a good ledge and three bolts (crux) traversing to the right to a ledge at the base of a dihedral.  Belay takes hand-size gear.    Pitch 3 - 5.11+, 70 feet     Head straight up the dihedral to the start of the flake system, then undercling to the left into a radical sustained undercling fingerlock traverse to a ledge with a tree.  Belay takes hand-size gear and a #4 BD.    Pitch 4 - 5.11+, 90 feet    Undercling/jam out the awkward flake to pumpy hand jams then powerful liebacking passed 4 fixed nuts.  Belay at a stance as the flake turns lower angle, or better yet, combine with Pitch 5.  Belay takes finger- and thin hand-size gear.    Pitch 5 - 5.11, 50 feet    Continue up the flake to a thin crack crux through a short roof.  Belay on a good sloping ledge.  Belay takes hand-size gear.    Pitch 6 - 12-, 130 feet    Jam/lieback up the wide slightly expando pancake flake (5.9) saving a #4 BD for the belay.  After a stance, head up the stellar big fingers to thin hands corner (5.11-) to another stance.  Fire up good fingers to a thought-provoking undercling flake (crux) to a \"thank God\" slam dunk jug.  Cruise up to a good ledge.  Belay takes #3 and bomber #4 BD cams.    Pitch 7 - 5.10, 180 feet    Scramble up and right through a bush, then straight up a short awkward dihedral (5.10), then 3rd class through some trees straight up to the base of a thin corner.  Belay at one of the trees.    Pitch 8 - 5.9 or 5.6, 160 feet    Climb up the corner to a ledge and a bush, then choose your own adventure left to the original 5.9 lieback, or right through 5.6 fingers then straight up through ever widening low-angle cracks to the summit ledge.

Climb 30 ft of crack and face to gain a big ledge with an intermediate anchor (makes for a fun, if short, pitch of 10d sport on it\\'s own). Climb up a juggy flake, clip another bolt out right and then traverse up and over to the arete. Climb past an undercling with an old smashed-up wasp nest, and then you get into the business.    The crux is a V3 boulder problem below the penultimate bolt. The Reid Guide is confusing because it\\'s description for the route is \"When in doubt, stay right\", and there\\'s some slopers and features out right, above a copperhead. But this is harder than it looks, and makes for a scary fall. You actually want to stay on the left side of the arete, and use sidepull edges along a seam in opposition to the arete.    After the crux is a bit more of 5.11 \\'don\\'t-blow-it-now\\' climbing past one more bolt to the anchor. At the end you want to swing over to the right and mantle the dirty shelf, then blindly reach around left to clip the anchor. This is maybe what Don Reid was referring to by \"staying right\".',\n",

The start of this climb is unpleasant, but the crux at the top is sort of cool. A better variation would be to climb the first half of Total Wayist and then finish on Solid Waste.\",\n",

Pitch 1 (5.11d): Just to the right of the crux pitch of the Regular route is a finger- to off-finger crack. While slightly less steep than its neighbor, the awkward size and poor feet make it considerably harder. Climb this and then switch cracks, continuing up to a 2-bolt belay in a bay bush.    Pitch 2 (5.10b): Climb flakes up to a slowly widening crack, starting with hands and going all the way to 5\". Continue past the small roof and build a gear anchor right after this in a finger crack. This pitch is hard for the grade (I suggest 5.10c) and takes all sizes of gear.    Pitch 3 (5.11a): Climb up to the enormous, can\\'t-miss-it offwidth. Sustained armbarring and eventually stacking will get you to where it pinches down to hand-size. Carefully traverse left to the Pitch 6 belay on the Regular route. You\\'ll want to pull out all of the wide arsenal for this. The guidebook says 5.11a but I thought it was about 5.10d.    From here, you have several choices for your 4th pitch.     Option 1, leftmost: This pitch is called the Excellent Adventure. I haven\\'t done this, but it takes you up a finger crack to the Rostrum Roof.

(5.11b)    Option 3, rightmost: This is the original Blind Faith finish. Start as with the handcrack, but when you get to the hanging flake bust right into a flare. Belay at the top of this or if you like, continue up the P8 offwidth to the top. (5.10d)    Pitch 5:    Option 1, leftmost: Original Regular route finish. Don\\'t really know much about it except that it goes at 5.12b.    Option 2, center: The Alien finish. Also 5.12b.    Option 3, rightmost: Depending on how you did the last pitch, you may or may not have to traverse under the roof until you are standing at the base of a right-facing corner.

       "  'description': 'As you approach the base of the North Face, this will be the obvious corner just to the right of the first rappel. Lots of people have probably looked at it, but judging from the lichen, no one has climbed it in several years. Rap in to a sloping ledge with a bolted anchor at the base of the corner, then lead back out. You could also set some directionals and mini-traxion it if you wanted.    Starts with some good finger locks, then becomes really shallow and flared. Requires some \"laybacking\" as the name suggests. Placing pro is tricky, hard to see, and super strenuous. After pulling over onto a ledge, continue up the corner and gully on rock that is carpeted with lichen. Mantel out left at the very end to regain the ledge at the top of the rappels.    I ran a wire brush down the main corner crack, but it still needs a lot of cleaning. Most Bachar FA\\'s have gotten their ratings upgraded in guidebooks over the years. This is one of those obscure routes, like Moongerms, which has had few repeats and still retains the \"old-school\" rating (5.11b in the Reid Guide). For what it\\'s worth, this is much harder than the Kaukulator, Blind Faith, pitch 4 of N Face, Uprising, and probably even harder than the Alien Roof.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Rostrum is a truly rad climb.  Every pitch is high quality and would be sought after individual classics were they at any crag, but stacked on top of each other they create a superb and memorable challenge.  The climbing is secure, well protected, and physical.      Park at the pullout along the stone wall, or just past it at a dirt pullout.  Follow the trail(which begins just west of the stone wall) down past some slabs and on to an obvious rappel point on a tree.  Two more raps (all with a single 60m) take you to within 25 feet of the base.    P1:  Ascend a large left-facing crack/flake system to a final 5.8 squeeze chimney with a wild exit move.  Belay above the maw at bolts.  It helps to step left at a tree halfway up this pitch.  5.9.    P2:  Three options.      1):  Downclimb ten feet and traverse left to a thin crack system.  This traverse is balancey with minimal hands and sloping feet.  Climb back up until level with the belay, place gear (black Alien helpful) and punch it up the thin layback/fingerlock crack until it is possible to stem right to a flake at which point the climbing eases.  Continue to a belay stance on blocks with a good pin.  5.11a.      2):  Ascend the aforementioned left-facing flake straight up from the belay.  This goes at 5.10- and is R without large gear.  It appears extremely secure, however.    3):  Ascend a 5.10d flare to the right of the belay.  This looks less appealing than the previous options.    P3:  A long pitch.  Perform a difficult layback move off the belay up into the hand crack system.  Climb amazing steep hands to a roof, lieback and jam up through the roof, and up yet another awesome handcrack to a final stretch of jugs that lead to the halfway ledge.    Belay at a pin on the ledge.  5.10.    P4:  The crux.  Climb an easy ramp to a stance immediately below the pumpy but locker splitter finger crack.  Up this for 25 feet to a thank-god hand jam and rest stance.  It\\'s hard to fully recover here unless you can get your knee in, but I suggest getting as much back as you can.  Launch into an extremely pumpy layback flake, past a pin, for another 20 feet.  The pump is cumulative but complete recovery is possible if you can pull over the top.  Clip the optional anchor and traverse straight left to a right-facing wall with a steep 5.9 hand crack.  Follow this up to a bolted belay.  5.11c.    P5:  Two options.      1):  Continue up the steep, slick right-facing corner with good jams separated by long reaches.  Pull around a small roof at the top.  Belay at bolts.  5.10d.      2):  \"The Uprising\".  Step right and climb the sick, overhanging hands & fists crack up the face right of the traditional line.  If you climb the Uprising, it makes a lot of sense to link it into the next pitch.  5.11.    P6:  Take the big cam out of the pack.  Tricky face climbing right leads to a steep crack on the arete.  At the top perform a difficult crack switch move to gain the 5.10 offwidth.  Solid knee locks, hand stacks, and pushing of a 4.5 Camalot (#5 C4) over your head will get you to the top.  I found it quite enjoyable, but others have called it the crux.  There is a bolt and other small pro available on this pitch, and strong OW climbers could do without the large cam -- but since you need it for the standard final pitch (and can place it on many other pitches), you may as well bring it.  Also, it makes for a truly stupendous pitch to link this OW into the next pitch -- just save your hand-size cams.  Otherwise, belay at bolts.  5.10.    P7:  Three options.      1)  The traditional (and apparently best) line is to mantle through a bit of bird shit and then climb up to a large, fin-shaped feature that sticks straight out of the wall.  Ascend the left side of this with wild jams to some great stem rests.  Belay at a bolt in the alcove under the final headwall.  Soft for 5.11b.      2)  Supposedly it is also possible to ascend the right side of this fin at 5.10d but it doesn\\'t seem as good.      3)  There\\'s also the \"Excellent Adventure\" variation but I didn\\'t even look at it.  I think that, as you climb up next to the fin, there\\'s a finger crack out left that can be followed diagonally up to under the final headwall.  5.13?    P8:  Three options.    1)  The most common finish is to traverse straight right on easy ground, then up into a final 5.9 offwidth.  There is a difficult (5.10+) move to gain the OW, but once you\\'re in it it is rather easy (especially compared to the offwidth below).  Your big cam will protect the first half of the crack, but be warned that if you leave it behind the rope frequently will drag the cam irretrievably into the crack.  It\\'s better to use it as long as possible, then pull it out, and gun for the top -- do not fall.  Belay at a fixed anchor on a tree.    2)  The Alien Finish heads straight out the roof at 5.12b.  From under the roof it is possible to place a 0.75 Camalot to protect the initial moves.  These involve powerful moves from a great jam to a good undercling to either a thin finger jam over the lip or a flake.  The difficulties continue beyond this as you ascend twin finger cracks up the steep headwall.  Eventually you must switch cracks (by some bolts) to the original finish -- it is possible to switch cracks lower down at an obvious chalked up flake.  The upper part of the pitch is sustained rattley fingers -- save gear for this!    3)  The original finish is just left of the Alien and is also 5.12b.  I haven\\'t climbed it and don\\'t know too much about it, other then that you hand traverse left under the roof to access it (or do the \"Excellent Adventure\").    From the summit block, rap down into the notch, then do 35 feet of 5.4-5.5 up the other side to get back on the trail up to the road.  It\\'s also worth noting that if you want to only do the top half of the climb, or need to bail after the first half, passage to and from the trail and halfway ledge is possible via a short 5.6 traverse.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is a typical Yosemite gully thrash. There are a couple cruxes low down on the route that are interesting and challenging, but most of the climbing is unexposed and not very fun. It\\'s got lots of dirt and moss, but the bushwhacking isn\\'t too bad except for a pitch near the top. If you just want a mungeineering route up a wall that no one ever climbs to the top of, then go for it. If you want a gully with some actual good rock climbing, go do  or something. Oh, and don\\'t attempt this route if it has rained recently and it\\'s wet.    Approach by hiking up the climbers trail to the base of Manana, then follow the wall uphill to the right. Boulderfield Gorge is the massive gully in the corner where the west facing wall intersects the water-polished north facing wall. Pharaoh\\'s Beard should be visible a couple hundred feet to the right. On the left-hand wall inside the gully will be the overhanging 5.12 crack \"Lost and Found\".    The first few pitches lead up through three \"steps\" in the gully. Each step is guarded by a crux chockstone which must be climbed past. The first chockstone is passed on the left with some awkward jamming. The second chockstone requires some wild stemming and then a difficult mantel. The third chockstone is passed on the right with a \"pull-up\" move on a good hold. After some brief scrambling, climb onto a secondary ledge system on the left side of the gully. This avoids some mungey chimneys in the back of the main gully.    A couple more easy pitches tunnel behind two large chockstones to arrive at a debris strewn ledge below the \"Colossus\". This enormous chockstone (more of just an overhanging wall) is passed by climbing features on the right wall of the chimney. Start up a left facing OW flake, make a traverse right, then straight up on more flakes to a mungy ramp with another crux move.    Next is a rope-length of 3rd class up vegetated gully with ferns and thistles. Take the left gully. On the next pitch, step left to avoid scary looking chockstones and a dead snag, then bushwhack through a tree choked chimney. A couple rope-lengths of 4th class lead to the shoulder of the wall.    To descend:   Option 1: Rap down the main face of the wall. Two ropes are maybe required. Bring lots of webbing and stuff to leave as you will probably be establishing most of the rappels. If you can make it to the top of King Tut\\'s Tomb, it\\'s only 3 double rope raps to the ground from there.    Option 2: Bushwhack east and then north through breaks in the cliffs to reach the Valley rim. Hike cross-country to meet up with the Pohono Trail, which you can take to Glacier Point and either hitchhike back or walk down the 4-mile.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This route climbs the right side of the 500ft tower located directly above Manana. It\\'s dirty but has a couple redeeming pitches. The rock is mostly good and the climbing is mostly well protected. Gets morning shade. The Reid Guide calls it 5.10b, but doesn\\'t list any info on the FFA. Galen Rowel surely used aid on his 1968 ascent, and the green Roper guide lists the route as 5.9 A1. So I don\\'t know where the 10b rating comes from, but the crux pitch felt harder than The Sceptor (11a) to me.    We did a direct start by climbing a gully just to the right of Manana. It\\'s possible to avoid these first two pitches by hiking uphill to the west and then cutting back left on 3rd/4th class ledges to reach the base of pitch 3. I\\'ll describe the route as we climbed it, so the pitches will differ from what is in the Reid topo.    Pitch 1 (10a/b) Climb up the gully past a big tree and a ledge. The chimney pinches you out and you must make a couple big reaches between jams to get situated in the crack system above. Burly. Then follow the 6\" crack a bit to the right and cut back left to belay on a big ledge.    Pitch 2 (4th class) Do a little boulder problem to get up on the next ledge, and then follow the broad ledge system along the base of the wall for about 80ft to the right. Scramble up some more easy terrain and belay at the highest ledge.    Pitch 3 (5.8) A short pitch following the crack system up and left. Climb the double cracks with some stemming onto a big 30-degree slab. Walk to the back of the slab and belay at the base of the corner. The anchor takes nuts and 1-2\" cams.    Pitch 4 (5.9) Bushwhack past a small tree and then climb up the enjoyable steep corner. This would be a nice pitch if it were clean. This brings you up onto another tree covered ledge. You can belay here, or climb a bit further through a short steep section. There is a dirty crack a bit to the right which is undercut at the bottom and looks really hard to get into. I think this is perhaps the best way to go? I got off route here and climbed the crack just to the left which gains a long narrow ledge. The climbing above was hard and poorly protected so I followed the ledge all the way to the left near the arete and a small tree. I climbed up 20 ft and then traversed way back right on unprotected face climbing and features (5.4 R/X) to rejoin the route. My follower was able to climb directly up on toprope since I didn\\'t place pro anywhere on my round-a-bout variation. Whichever way you go, there is a good spot to build an anchor (nuts and small to medium cams) at the base of the steep crack and a place to sit on the big ledge immediately to the right.    Pitch 5 (5.11a) Another pitch which would be really fun if it were clean. Climb up the steep hand and fist crack. It is easier than it appears thanks to several large features to grab and step on. This brings you to another ledge. It\\'s probably a good idea to belay here if you didn\\'t climb all the way to the base of the crack on pitch 4. Otherwise keep going into the crux \"10b\" pitch. This section is just as steep and dirty as the previous, but also much thinner and less featured. Continuous climbing in a right-leaning corner and crack with a very pumpy finish. Move left along the sandy debris covered ledges and belay by some blocks under a roof.    Pitch 6 (5.8) A short bit of insecure climbing up the thin crack and face reaches a horizontal crack below the roof. Traverse right to where the roof is split by a chimney and wiggle up to the top of the formation.',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Steck-Salathe truly deserves its status as one of the \"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America\". Everything from the climbing itself to the many stories of adventure had on the north face of the Sentinel makes this climb a must-do for any aspiring Valley climber -- if not a route to be repeated again and again, it certainly should at least be seen as a rite of passage. The climb\\'s reputation for being long, wide, and physical is well deserved, but the quality of that climbing, the position one achieves, and the overall sense of adventure the route offers should not be understated.  On the first ascent in 1950 Allen Steck and John Salathe reached the top of the Flying Buttress (the first half of the route) in two days, and took another three to reach the summit (Royal Robbins made the second and third ascents a few years later). Today the route is commonly done by free-soloists in the lesser part of a morning; but this is also the climb that nearly resulted in the deaths of Dean Potter and Timmy O\\'Neill (a fantastic account of their antics appeared in one of the climbing mags a few years back), and did take the life of beloved Derek Hersey. Most parties should expect a very full day even with a first light start, but fast parties could certainly make it down for dinner if they move efficiently and link pitches. Originally rated 5.9, the route has been upgraded to 5.10b which is much more like it. Nevertheless, the 5.10 sections aren\\'t too bad -- it\\'s all those 5.8 and 5.9 wide pitches that present the true crux of the route. There are many ways to pitch out this climb; this description describes my experience on it.  Approach by parking at the Four Mile Trailhead. Follow this trail for a long half-mile to a point on the trail where a narrow, tree-shrouded talus slope heads up into the woods. This is sometimes marked by a cairn, but it is fairly easy to find: if in doubt, continue east on the main trail for a minute or two to an obvious stream bed (sometimes dry late in the season) and then backtrack 100-200 feet to the talus. Head up a well-defined climber\\'s trail in the talus until it eventually dead-ends at the base of the Sentinel at a steep, wide, west-trending ramp. This is a convenient place to rack up and stash the packs. Follow this ramp up until it eventually turns into a narrow system of catwalk-like ledges that weave back and forth up the north face of the Sentinel. This amazing passage (reminiscent of the approach to Hobbit Book in Tuolumne) gains about 1/3 of the height of the Sentinel via simple 3rd and 4th class scrambling. It\\'s hard to get lost on this ramp system, and eventually it opens up to a small, loose area near the western edge of the face. Continue scrambling up until you reach the base of a significant right-facing corner with, yes, a wide crack. This is the start of the route -- you can\\'t scramble any higher.  P1: A 60\\' right-facing corner with a wide crack in it. This can be negotiated with squeezing and OW skills, but I found it easier to lieback. 5.8, strenuous. I was glad to have a #4.5 Camalot (#5 C4). This leads to a belay stance which I skipped. Step right and continue up some 5.8 cracks to another stance and belay -- a long pitch.  P2: Climb a touch more 5.8 past some fixed gear, then easier terrain, then a brief finger crack, then wandering climbing up a gully system to some final wide cracks and a belay below the base of the Wilson Overhang. Another long pitch, 5.8.  P3: The Wilson Overhang. Climb up an ever-steepening chimney/corner system with a difficult to reach hand crack in the back. Eventually one must commit to either jamming and squeezing awkwardly or stemming out a ways with little pro. There are good face holds for doing the latter. Pull the overhang and climb easier ground up to a belay on a pedestal. This pitch is accurately rated 5.10a but is not the crux of the climb.  P4: Climb up an absolutely horrendous 5.9 squeeze and then traverse right and up to a belay at the base of a huge gully/chute system. Alternatively (highly recommended), skip the squeeze in favor of an unprotected 5.8 flake out right. The squeeze may very well be the crux of the route -- UGH.  P5 & P6: Climb one of many crack systems for the next two pitches up the gully/chute until it is possible to tunnel through the tip of the Flying Buttress to the left. This is a good area to simulclimb or pass other parties as there are many avenues. 5.8-5.10 depending on how you go. Belay at a rap station on the east side of the Flying Buttress -- this is the halfway point and after this retreat becomes more difficult. Do a short (40\\') rap off the anchor to another anchor at the base of a steep crack system. I guess you can also downclimb this section? Looked difficult.  P7: Ascend the steep and difficult crack system up to an obvious belay -- this is an interesting and challenging pitch. 5.9.  P8: Face climb up and right, then wander sharply back left and up to a belay below a long corner/slot that leads up into The Narrows. There are several fixed pieces protecting this pitch, but small/medium wires work well too. 5.9 and a somewhat heady change of pace from all the thrutching thus far. Don\\'t worry -- its all thrutching the rest of the way from here.  P9: This corner to flare to chimney is rated 5.10b which would lead one to believe its the crux of the climb, but it goes quite well, especially if you\\'re willing to leave the security of the gear in the corner and stem and chimney your way up it a little to the outside. The pitch links very easily into the next pitch, the Narrows, and this is what we did.  P10: The Narrows. If you skipped the 5.9 squeeze after the Wilson Overhang in favor of the 5.8 flake, then this is the unquestionable crux of the route. The Narrows was originally climbed by aiding up a bolt ladder on the outside of the slot, but ever since Robbins\\' ascents, the way to go has been right up into that hole. Approaching it, unlike Astroman\\'s Harding Slot, is relatively easy. In fact, you can get most of your upper body into the Narrows while your lower body is still comfortably back-footing in the wider chimney below. The problem is advancing the next yard or so: One must drop one\\'s feet and figure out some way to make upwards progress in a squeeze chimney using only body parts from the hips up. I managed this by using the back of my head on the back wall to pull my body upwards while simultaneously exhaling, then taking a deep breath to hold that position while I groped for a higher purchase with the back of my head. Hey, it worked. Gear for inside The Narrows really isn\\'t necessary, but a fist-size cam (#3.5 Camalot/#4 C4) works well to protect the initial moves. For most of this you feel pretty alone with only the sound of your own gasping, and the tinkling sound of the hangers on the old aid bolts blowing freely in the wind on the outside of the slot, for company. Perhaps you\\'ll wish you were out there hanging from those bolts, but perservere -- eventually things will start going a little more quickly. At last you can stem up out of The Narrows to an incredibly exposed position high on the upper face of the Sentinel. Peer down at the old bolt ladder, and the valley floor two thousand feet below. A few more feet of easy climbing leads to a nice belay. 5.9? Yeah, sure.  P11: At this point a stout looking pine tree appears way above. This actually is the location of the final real belay on the climb. Not much further, huh? Continue up a fun 5.7 chimney to a very cool belay at bolts on top of a chockstone.  P12: Continue up the chimney until forced to pull out left through a steep section at a hangerless bolt (plenty of gear to back it up). Belay where convenient. 5.8.  P13: Aim for the tree. Head up and left through a very steep, but short, section of hand or fist cracks (switching between them where necessary). Some of this rock is fairly low quality, but after one last little mantle into the dirt and pine needles, you can taste victory. Belay at the big tree.  P14: An easy pitch continues up the east-trending ramp at low 5th class, then steps around the corner and belays just below the summit.  Descent: Before attempting this descent for the first time, take into account the amount of daylight you have remaining. If it\\'s dark already, consider waiting it out and beginning at first light. You should try to do at least the first two thirds of the descent in the daylight. Part 1: Follow a passage east through manzanita and boulders until it turns into a huge gully that heads down to the east. Follow the obvious trail along the southern (right) wall of this gully until it eventually begins switching back down the center. This gully is often loose and very steep at times and requires much care to follow the trail, which is the easiest path. At one point a rappel is reached, but this is not necessary -- there is a 4th/low-5th passage down just before reaching the rap, but it appears improbable from above. Eventually you will reach a stream which must be crossed. Note: This stream is the one that crosses the Four Mile Trail just after the talus on the approach; it is also visible (as water streaks/wet sections of rock) from Camp 4 when looking up at the valley wall just left (east) of the Sentinel. The stream is spring-fed and safe to drink from -- a good thing to know when planning for how much water to carry on the climb. Part 2: After crossing the stream, begin heading north (left) on steep slabs. You want to stay in the middle of the slab or western 1/2 of it (near the Sentinel). The base of the slabs terminate in dense trees. Part 3: Continue scrambling down and east (right) along the base of the slabs to a non-descript point at which you enter the trees. Find the path of least resistance -- expect some bushwhacking. You can more or less head north and west to reach the climber\\'s trail and the Four Mile Trail, but if you left equipment at the base of the ramp, you\\'ll have to cut sharply back west to reach that point.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Over the summer of 2014, Jake Whittaker and I put up a new free route approximately 100 yards left of Widow\\x92s Tears amphitheater. We called the climb The Lurch (7 pitches, 5.12c/d), after one of the last moves on the route\\x97by far the crux.       The Lurch follows an obscure, unknown aid line that may be from the \\x9290s, judging by the bolts at some anchors. Our line veers from the aid route in a few places to allow for free climbing and/or avoiding death. For example, a leftward traverse on the fourth pitch avoids monstrous and very precariously stacked, Volkswagen-size chunks of granite.    This route is characterized by quality stone, quality climbing, and relative safety. It\\x92s a great route to throw oneself at if pushing the grade. And if you don\\x92t climb 12+, this might be a good one to see where you\\x92re at\\x97you can really go for it at the cruxes. The seven pitches go at 10+, 11a/b, 12b, 11c/d, 10c, 12a, and 12c/d, and some are short for ease of belays and diminishing rope drag on the hard sections. Overall, the route is PG, but the cruxes are as G as G can be.    At the top of this no-summit, silly little route tucked into an obscure corner of the Ditch, climbers will be rewarded with a secluded, stunningly gorgeous perch where they can sit in peace, breathe, and take in the overall contentment that only accompanies climbing routes longer than a few pitches.    Thank you Jake Whittaker, for this fun filled time.  You taught me so much on this one.    Here is a beta video on the crux.   ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Approach: Park at Wawona Tunnell parking lot and walk down highway 41 towards Yosemite Valley. Look for a large talus field that leads up to the Widow's Tears Amphiteater. Hike up towards the amphiteater, pass the large road that runs horizontal to the approach and cut right when you reach the base of the wall that forms a buttress on the right side of the waterfall. Continue walking west at the base of the wall till you can scramble up and right on 3rd and 4th class ledges. When you gain some elevation and hit vertical walls, turn east and find the base of the route. There is a large tree right across from it. Yes, you will really have to climb over that giant roof that looms above.    P1. Jam, lay-back, and do some off-fingers jamming for 70 feet. There is a fixed piton which is backed up by cams for the belay. 5.10a (felt no easier than 5.10c pitch higher up)   p2. Climb over the giant roof. Helps to be able to do a pull up on fingerjams. Also, helps to not place gear above the lip of the roof so you can use it for jamming. After you figure it out traverse right and belay at the tree. 5.11a 70 feet. Felt harder than 11a.   p3. Traverse back left from the tree and to the base of the giant dihedral. 80 ft 5.8   p4. Overhanging corner with hand jamming, fists and thin hands to cap it off. Bring a variety of cams from BD#1 to #4. 0.75s are good for building an anchor on top of the pitch. 120 feet, 5.11a - physical.    p5. Climb up the zig-zagging thin hands and off fingers crack. Great climbing and fun moves. 120 feet 5.10c.   Now you are on top of Windfall.     P6. Scramble left and up to a dirty chimney. 5.7 chimney that feels hard till you look around and find more features all around you. Climb up and belay at the base of a short headwall with a splitter crack. 150ft   P7. Climb over to the top of the short headwall and traverse a bit left. Best to skip placing pro till you get to the base of the AWESOME 5.10c crack. It starts from BD #0.75 (green) size. It would be even better to belay at the base to avoid rope drag, but make sure you have a few extra .75s for the belay. This pitch accepts lots of finger and mid size pieces, bring nuts. Great pitch. 150 ft from the ledge at the base of the headwall.   P8. Climb up the white headwall and into a wide crack to your left. Make sure to bring your #4 cams. 140 ft 5.10a. Belay past the tree below the chockstone. Wild belay spot.   P9. Squeeze chimney with sparse pro. Don't fall till you place your first pro 25ft up or so. Continue up via enjoyable chimneying. 5.8/9 120ft. Belay from trees at the base of a little forest.   P10. Scramble over the 200ft section of forest and bushwhacking. 4th class ledges in places. WOuld be hard to fall off here though because concentration of bushes is far greater than exposure.    P11. There is a jamcrack that starts from an obvious corner. You will see a beautiful fistcrack that marks the end of the route higher up, so climb towards it. 120ft 5.8. Stop at thebase of a corner with a lieback.   p12. Do a few burly layback moves and get on the ledge with a little tree growing on the west side of the ledge. This tree seemed like the best pro that could be used to protect the slab traverse (5.10a) which starts up from the eastern side of the ledge. Pay attention to your foot work and don't blow it. Continue up the wide crack to the top of the route 160 ft.    Descent: Scramble over to the top of Stanford point, take a bunch of photos, and walk down to Wawona Tunnell using a perfect class 1 trail. One of the best descents I have done.\",\n",

The route is on the buttress that forms the right side of the amphitheater.     Look for a large, deep natural drainage down off the right side of the road - it's a ways down the road. Start hiking uphill just past this drainage. Go uphill through trees and mossy boulders until you reach an old roadbed that runs parallel to Highway 41.     A few cairns on the old road mark the spot to continue uphill. If you don't see them just continue uphill through a large talus field trending towards the right side of the formation. We found it easiest to follow the talus drainage all the way to the base of the wall, a few hundred meters right of the start of the route. This makes for an easier traverse over to the base.     Descent: You can rap Windfall with a single 70m rope in three rappels. As of 10/2014, the first rap anchor, at the top of the 10c splitter, consists of two nice fixed nuts and a sling.

The crux sequence begins after you gain the first crimp, meaning everyone and their uncle touches this problem. The bottom crimps can get slippery as a result.    Start on the low sloping rail and move left to a couple of mediocre crimps.  Do a big throw to a sharp but slightly incut crimper flake followed by a couple of easy crimping sequences on decent hands/feet.  Core up to the sloper rail, mantle said rail, and don't biff the easy 5th class slab to the top.    There's also a left variation called Thunderhead which holds the same grade.  Thunderbird seems the physically harder of the two (though I personally have not sent Thunderhead).\",\n",

The 5.10a crux is a short overhanging hand crack on pitch 6. The route is Grade III 5.10a or 5.9 C1 PG13.  (1)5.7. 165 feet. 1 bolt. Follow a series of single and parallel cracks to where they end to the left of a large roof (5.4 - 5.6). Traverse up and slightly right to join a long crack fifteen feet above the large roof on the right. As this crack ends, climb up and right to the anchor with bolt-protected 5.7 face climbing which is the crux of the first pitch.  (2)5.8. 150 feet. 5 bolts. Climb past two bolts (some 5.8) to a small dihedral. Step up left to a ramp and another bolt. Ascend slightly up and left to another bolt on a face. Diagonal up and to the right below the obvious small bush to a ledge with a bolt. This ledge is slightly higher and to the right (looking up) of the small bush. Climb 5.8 face to the belay.  (3)5.8. 180 feet. Face climb (8 bolts) to anchor at base of The Ramp.  (4)5.7. 190 feet. 3 bolts. Climb The Ramp using a combination of the crack and face climbing. There is a bolt where the crack becomes a seam and two more bolts near the end of the pitch. The belay is on a good stance next to some small trees. Extending all the pro with slings is highly recommended.  (5) 5.9. 140 feet. 4 bolts. From the belay move up a few feet above the belay bolts and then traverse right above the trees by the belay to a bolt below a small tapering roof. Go around or over the bottom of the roof and then up past two bolts to a thin crack which leads up and right. Follow the crack (protected with an old fixed piton and small cams) until it ends then delicately ascend (5.9) to a bolt. From here climb mostly straight up until coming to a ledge. The anchors are to the left/north on the ledge. Extending all the pro with slings is highly recommended.  (6)5.10a or 5.7-5.8 C1. 190 feet. 1 bolt. Ascend slightly up and left from the belay to a bolt (5.7-5.8). Climb from here up a sloping ramp to the obvious corner above and to the right of the belay. Ascend the crack (5.10a) by jamming/lie-backing. This crack can also be aided at C1. An optional belay can be placed just above the crack to better protect the follower. Continue right/south along the ramp until the wall above it ends, and it is possible to exit up to the ridge. There are several belay points within twenty feet above the end of the wall.  From the last belay, scramble about 100 feet of easy 3rd class to the top.   (refer to 3 beta photos): After topping out on the ridge, go up the ridge about 100 yards and follow some easy ledges/slabs down and left (east).  As you descend, aim for the solitary, ~20\\x92 tree that has no lower branches, a roughly light tan trunk, and one dead branch pointing straight up. From the tree, diagonal down towards the very obvious, large dead tree that is just beyond the edge of the slab at the bottom of the ridge.  From the lower tree, work over and down to within a few hundred feet of the top edge of the buttress. You may find a line of cairns here which lead down to the base of the buttress. Hike down around the east side of the buttress. No down-\\xadclimbing is necessary (stay away from the edge).  At the base of the buttress where the slabs meet the talus, there are some choices: (1) A quick traverse through the top of the talus leads back around to the center of the Buttress and the JMT. (2) Traverse around the bottom of the talus field and then work over to the base of the buttress or the JMT. (3) Continue down through the east edge of the burned area and traverse back over and up (roughly northwest) to the JMT at the point where you first see the Buttress when you are coming up the JMT from the parking lot.',\n",

Start by climbing a steep handcrack until you gain a small stance on the pillar itself. Clip a mangled rusty piton , you can also fiddle a small cam or nut in to backup the pin. This is the last pro on the route.    Make some exposed face moves to gain another small ledge . From here you are fully committed on the pillar. You must make two distinct 5.9 moves on mostly positive knobs to reach the summit jugs on top.    There is (1) old quarter inch bolt on top with a newer looking quick link through it. You can bring up a second from the top. To descend, run the rope through the quick link , and then run the rope around a solid horn on top. You can safely rap from the bolt and horn.    Panic Pillar is an excellent adventure after a Cathedral summit or on your way to Eichorn. It is a pretty serious lead, and the fall potential near the top should not be underestimated.',\n",

All the bolts on all 3 routes are very hard to see at first, so start squinting!    Follow up green overlaps and then up the steepening wall through a sea of continuously small knobs. At 2/3rds height, the route angles left across a depression and then over a bulge to lower angle and the bolted rap anchor.\",\n",

I think the name is also fitting because of its proximity to Bombs Over Tokyo, but either way, Blown Away is absolutely classic.    P1:  Climb the first pitch of West Crack.  5.9.    P2:  Climb through the roof of West Crack\\'s second pitch, then continue up the OW for a ways before departing the crack and moving left at a bolt to a bolted belay.  5.8.    P3:  Climb a splendid rising traverse pitch across the beautiful face.  This pitch passes ten bolts or so and generally aims for a ledge on the left margin of the wall.  Be careful to follow the right line -- there is another route (Weenie Roast) that intersects this one and you don\\'t want to stray onto it.  Belay on this ledge with gear and a lone bolt.  5.9.    P4:  Climb the incredible, exposed arete with gear and bolts up through the hanging dihedral.  Belay at bolts over the roof.    P5:  An easy romp to the top.',\n",

       "  'description': 'A classic 4-5 pitch dihedral with all types of crack climbing but mainly liebacking and finger locks. This is another great route on Daff that gets plenty of summer afternoon sun.  Three starting options exist; the original 5.9 dihedral that passes a fun roof to an awkward and physical slot then sweet jams - a great pitch, what appears to be a runout 5.9 face to easy crack pitch with one bolt or a 5.7 crack with steep face to enter it. The first two options lead to the same fixed anchor (tat with a rap ring) and the third option is a gear belay on a decent ledge.  From the fixed anchor at the end of the first pitch you should continue the second pitch left past easy jamming with lots of knob footholds until a 5.8 traverse at a big hand hold / pod in the crack allows a crack switch left about 5 feet, this is exciting for the second. Alternatively you can make a 20 foot rappel to the top of the 5.7 crack or down climb to it 5.7. The second pitch ends at huge ledge. The optional 5.7 crack first pitch start avoids the exciting traverse for your partner on the second pitch.  The third pitch jams and laybacks up a wonderful corner to belay at a small stance, easy 5.9 with #3 camalot belay.   Fourth pitch runs up to a large loose flake then underclings the quick 5.10- crux (small offset stoppers or tiny cams) to more good jamming. Belay at the top of the dihedral to watch your partner or continue to the top with easy safe climbing.',\n",

Awkward fingers and hip scumming up, then out another roof. 100', lots of sustained .9.   : off the ledge with the hangarless bolt, up and out the roof, then up another slick corner with very awkward hands. Up to a huge ledge. sustained awkward .9, 60 feet.    I combined 2 and 3 no problem with a 60m rope and a double cam rack with a single #3. ledge is huge and comfy.   : guidebook crux. mostly .7 and .8 slab. Hard part is getting gear in the seam on the corner/roof. It's there, but it's thin and placing it can be strenuous. The crux move felt like .10a slab, and is well protected on both sides. Then fun knob climbing past a pin to the belay.   : easy 5th to the top.   : follow cairns to the east side of the dome. Big ledge with a tree. Chains on top of a huge block. 2 raps with a 60m to the ground. maybe 1 rap with a 70?    Agreed that the sustained .9 is harder than the single crux move.\",\n",

Lowest third involves a bit of good footwork, then an easy scramble for the middle third, then the top bit is probably the crux and trickier than it looks.    The base is on the disabled trail to Glacier Point so be very careful not to obstruct it - however the trail is very wide at that point - easily wide enough for buggies with room left over for ropes and a belayer. It may be worth checking with the rangers in the gift shop that it's OK to do this, though a ranger was supportive of our efforts!    Suspect there are other routes up the same crag which could be done with a bit of tweaking of the same anchor.\",\n",

Rope up at the lodge-pole and follow a trough up and right to a belay bolt. Traverse right (5.8), then climb up and right to a very brush ledge. Continue up and right for about 200 feet, then traverse right 30 feet and climb straight up past loose flakes to a ledge. Proceed upward over more flakes and a few small overhangs for 300 feet to ledge on lower angle rock. And easy pitch ends at the summit slabs.     (modern beta from mtnyoung on supertopo)   Pitch 1: (5.6) Look for three pine trees grouped close to the base of The West Face of Mt. Starr King. Begin at the north-most of these trees (this north-most tree\\x92s trunk forks partway up.) Follow a shallow, left facing corner/trough about 100 feet to an 18 inch wide roof (which is heavily marked by yellow lichen.) Good protection under the roof is followed by 25 feet of unprotected 5.6 slab, up and slightly left, ending at a two bolt belay on a lower angle section of face. (This pitch might be as long as 150 feet, depending on where a party ropes up.)    Pitch 2: (5.8) Traverse straight right for 25 feet to a right facing corner/flake (5.8). Go up and right along, and then over this. Continue toward a large bush which is on top of a thin ledge. Pass below the bush, moving onto the ledge just to its right. Belay 20 feet further up and right. (About 160 feet)    Pitch 3: (5.6) Unprotected 5.6 leads up and right 25 feet to the base of a prominent left facing corner. This \\x93spreads out\\x94 to become multiple corners higher. Belay not far above where the corners spread out. (140 feet)    Pitch 4: (5.8) Traverse left 30 feet across the tops of flakes and ledges to a single bolt. Three more well spaced bolts protect climbing straight up on a beautiful, golden slab to a point directly under a wide flake/roof. From the fourth bolt, move left five feet to a right facing corner (at a point where that right facing corner meets the roof.) Fun moves lead over the roof, then up and left 15 feet, to an excellent belay ledge. (150 feet)    Pitch 5: (5.8) Follow right facing corners upward, being careful to trend to the right, even though, in some places, leftward movement appears easier. Look for the best, most solid, crack system in which to belay. (170 feet, plus or minus)    Pitch 6: (5.5) Climb right and up a little, staying below blank and dirty sections of rock and roofs. After moving right, around a corner/roof, an up-and-left crack continues 50 feet; it starts at hand size and narrows to finger size. Belay on top of flakes above and right of the end of this crack. (170 feet)    Pitch 7: (5.0) Eighty more feet of easy flakes and face leads to the end of the climbing. Two hundred fifty feet more of class 3 and class 2 lead to the summit.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Game on, rated 10b in an older guide and now rated 10d in the new guides, the bouldery crux of this route still felt hard for the rating. Clipping the second bolt will keep your attention but not as much as clipping the poorly placed 3rd bolt. The climbing remains sustained to the anchor and calling it 10 easy is misleading. A hand size optional piece in the older guide and small optional pro suggested in the Supertopo guide is only recommended if you like carrying extra weight. You could place a hand size piece before the anchor that might hold body weight but would send rock down on your belayer as it ripped out in the event of a fall. You might also get a smaller piece to the left that could hold a fall but you would be blocking what I felt was a crucial undercling hold. While fairly well bolted by TM standards this sport route constantly felt sporty.',\n",

Albers (from comments)   The first pitch belay is actually in a scoop about 30 feet below the bolts you mentioned, though using the bolts is fine as long as nobody is using them for the face climb they are there for.   The second pitch continues up the crack past a bulge (bring a 4 inch piece for the bulge) and up the nice hand crack to a another scoop to belay...maybe 120-130 feet from the bolts.   Third pitch continues until the crack ends and you are on 4th class, belay where you can. You can then climb out on 4th class from this belay, though many will want a belay for the last bit of 4th class to the top of the dome (it is exposed). Enjoyable climb.   Cheers.\",\n",

Follow the right trending ramp up and back right to the first bolt. Climb up past three more bolts to a double bolt anchor with chains.

       "  'description': \"This is probably one of the best 5.12s in Tuolumne.  The crux 12c third pitch is CLASSIC sporty sport climbing with a very exciting and powerful crux on immaculate golden overhanging knobs. The position is exhilarating.   There is potential for big but clean air potential at the crux!  With no topo or route description for this climb, I pieced together some beta from Katie Lambert, but I'm  not sure if I climbed the first and final pitch correctly.  Really though, the middle two pitches are what you come for.  Be prepared for some serious runouts on easier sections, especially on pitch one and four.  Go for the victory whip from the top of the last pitch and break both your legs.    Pitch One:  5.10,  Look for the obvious bolted arete, and start to the left of this.  I think you can do some runout 5.10 at the start but I just headed up the obvious ramp to the right eventually reaching a single bolt and then a committing/dangerous  but surprising secure 5.10  knob crux.  Wander up knobs heading towards a ledge at the base of the obvious gold arete, and a 2 bolt anchor.  It would be possible to start on Sunshine which might offer a more classic first pitch, or for hard-person points Anatolio.     Pitch Two: 5.11d,  Place one cam in the corner, then head out to arete, and a uncharacteristically well protected 11d arete pitch on golden knobs, with the crux at the end getting to the ledge with 2 bolts. Excellent climbing.  Lament the fact that the crux pitch is not bolted this way.    Pitch Three:  The Money Pitch! Head out left off the anchor and clip two bolts and then get ready to boulder.  There is no clipping up this one.  This is really one of the best pitches I've done in Tuolumne. I couldn't figure out the sustained boulder problem on lead and figured out a way to toprope it before I red-pointed it... still quite thrilling as a head point.   Straight up off the anchor is the crux pitch of Sunshine 5.10d R.  From the anchor of this amazing pitch you can pendulum over to the Acapulco anchor to work the crux.  Did I mention this pitch is AMAZING!    Pitch Four: and maybe Five.  Choose your own adventure!  Head up slightly left off the anchor to a single bolt.  Look up into a sea of knobs with absolutely no idea where the first ascent went.  No matter where you go, it's going to be a run out affair.  When Sean Leary was still alive Katie asked him where he went on this pitch, but he couldn't remember.  My solution was to climb straight up off the bolt and then eventually trend up and right onto Sunshine.  I belayed at a two bolt anchor on sunshine about 60 feet below the top and then finished on the unprotected 5.7+ pitch.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Totally Awesome! Well the first two pitches are great! If I were to do the route again I would skip the third (which is Sunshine and quite exciting/scary), the fourth (sort of contrived feeling) and fifth pitches and link into the third (looks RAD!) and fourth pitches of Acapulco Gold.    --------------------------------------------------    P1. A very cool pitch of liebacking, knob pulling and mantling. Unless we both missed a bolt at the crux, it would be a bad fall if you blow the hard move at the top of the shallow left facing corner at the start (3rd bolt). Otherwise the pro is super bolted to two bolt chained anchor. (11a/b and fun)      P2. Up and left to the blunt arete of the beautiful gold plaque of smooth knobs. Halfway up the line of bolts, traverse right through a crux section (10+) and onto the slab under the big roof...Cool! This looks RAD!! Out the right side of the roof's apex is a traversing seam above a smooth face. A red Camalot extended with two runners fits well and deep in one of the slots low under the roof. I placed a red Alien in the handjam size slot at the beginning of the traverse, which allowed me to still lean off the jam and stretch up to the good undercling and place a bomber green Alien (green Camalot will then fit in the handjam, too). Prepare to get a little cramped-up on the undercling and cross-through moves out right. A brilliant sequence past the green Alien hits a double-handed sloper and shitty feet. If you can hold on, there are a couple options for gear. I placed a red Alien in an undercling (yellow Alien maybe in another slot or possibly a gold Camalot, big nut or Hex in the vertical crack in front of you). If you can't hold on to place a piece, its a big whipper onto the green Alien and maybe the slab. If your belayer is on it, it should be a clean fall (I tested this fall theory on my first go). Once you get to the lip/end of the roof, clip a fixed nut (if its there) with a doubled runner and power up the sequential corner all the way to the next roof. Ever so gingerly stem hard out right where a yellow or red Alien (better) fits. Yikes!! Another couple moves takes you to a bolted anchor with big quick-links. To protect the follower, I clipped the first bolt of Acapulco Gold's second pitch with a runner. (12b/c and amazing)     P3. Sunshine for 30 feet...Funky and run out to a good Lost Arrow (9 R). Weird knobs lead toward the roof (10- R. Load up the flake and make a crazy traverse (5.7 X) left across these wild tiered ledges to knobs and finally a bolted anchor w/o chain or links.       P4-5. Connect the dots of hard to see bolts that mostly follow cleaner gold knobs left of big, loose flakes. Just to the right of where Gram traverse finishes. (10- R with some fun knob sections)\",\n",

All anchors are bolted belays. The Crux is one move of 10.C face climbing that can be aided past if necessary. The route takes the path of most resistance up easier terrain. It is possible to link the first two pitches with a 70m rope. The final fourth pitch has the crux.

Some have said that the rock is sketchy on this climb, but overall it is quite good and this shouldn't scare anyone away.  The climbing on Gram is physical whereas the climbing on OZ is more technical -- a nice contrast and finish to the route.    After finishing the third pitch of OZ, continue as follows:    P4:  Climb up off the belay through some very powerful laybacks and underclings to a stance.  The climbing eases here until a bolted belay is reached below some hanging blocks.  5.10d.    P5:  Runner your gear very well and still expect to deal with rope drag.  Continue traversing under the roof with a few cruxy downclimbing sections of 5.10c or so.  One can belay off of bad gear or at an uncomfortable stance, but it is perhaps better to turn the roof at it's end and continue to the top.  Keep in mind this involves climbing a long passage of 5.5 knobs without much gear.  An awesome, exposed conclusion to the climb.  5.10c.\",\n",

I usually pronounce it \"ounce\" but sometimes I slip and say \"Oz.\"  When I\\'m feeling posh I say \"oh zee.\"    P1:  Begin at a little flake system well right of the huge dihedral above.  This flake system intersects a low roof.  Some tricky small gear protects this pretty well and gains a long left-angling flake/crack.  Follow this to its apex and belay.  5.10a.    P2:  Perform a tricky move up off the belay, then step left and climb past three bolts and a difficult hand traverse on slopers (crux).  This reaches a rest stance.  There is one more difficult face passage past a few more bolts before the climbing eases.  Climb up cracks and ledges to a belay on a sloping ramp that leads directly into the long corner.  A long pitch, 5.10d.    P3:  Climb the awesome, overhanging thin hands corner.  This pitch is soft for 10c and has many rest stances.  It is steep and amazing however.  Belay below the huge roof that caps Drug Dome.    P4:  Climb out left past a few bolts, around the arete, then up easy terrain to a belay below the summit.  5.9.  Or, better yet, do the Gram Traverse!    Excessive gear for the dihedral really isn\\'t necessary as there are enough constrictions and pods to fit a varity of equipment.

       "  'description': 'When put up in the mid 70\\'s this was your typical Tuolumne hard man horror show with single, 1/4\" bolt belays, 1-2 pieces of protection per pitch, etc. Nowadays with other routes in the area and rebolting the route has been tamed a bit, but it is still an exciting adventure.  My description is of the line of the original first ascent from a topo drawn by the first ascent party. Variations, most notably of the first and second pitches, exist.  Pitch 1 - start in a small right facing corner/ramp which leads up and left to a ledge. Once you gain the ledge, climb more or less straight up the face on knobs past one bolt to a two-bolt anchor(5.9).  Pitch 2 - climb up a small right facing corner/crack to a roof. \\xa0A 5.10a move right under the roof(hard to protect for the second) leads for about 20-25 feet right until a break allows one to climb over the roof(5.8). Proceed up to a belay with two bolts with rings. \\xa0Note: this isn\\'t actually the 2nd pitch belay on the original route. \\xa0It appears to be a belay from an unfinished route right of Sunshine, but the double bolts are not only convenient, but the actual 2nd pitch belay, below the 5.10a mantle with a bolt on the slab below is still a single bolt. \\xa0Climber\\'s choice!  Pitch 3 - head up and left to a bolt on a 20 degree slab below a small, double roof(original 2nd pitch belay). Do a double mantle over the roof(5.10a) with a fixed pin then proceed up and left to a belay at a large flake with two bolts.  Pitch 4 - the crux pitch(5.10d). Climb up a steep face past a fixed pin to a small roof. Surmount the roof and belay at a small ledge on the left with two bolts and rings.  Pitch 5 - move right and get pro in a small crack then go up and a bit left on knobs(5.9) to a two bolt belay with rings near a large, peach-sized knob.  Pitch 6 - continue climbing to the top. No protection to speak of, but only 5.7.  Sometime in the late 1970\\'s or 1980\\'s a 2-pitch variation to the original two pitches of Sunshine was climbed. It joins the original route at the 5.10 mantle with a bolt on a 20 degree sloping ledge. This is the 6th bolt on the second pitch of the variation. \\xa0Rather than belay at this single bolt the variation continues up to the anchors on top of the original 3rd pitch.  The variation begins about 30-50\\' right of the original start, just left of the obvious arete of the climb Push It. \\xa0It shares the same start as the route Roof Rat. \\xa0The description below is from John Scott(AKA Donner Summit).  \\xa0P1 40m Head up the obvious corner and step left onto the face below a pin. You can sling a knob to protect the move to the pin. Work left and up the face/corner with plenty of gear options. Step left around the corner just above a new anchor with mussy hooks. Sling a knob and continue to the obvious belay ledge and anchor. There are no bolts on this pitch.(5.9) \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0P2 25m An offset protects the move to the 1st bolt. The mantle above the 1st bolt has a broken hold. Maybe a little harder now. After the 2nd bolt go left not up. You can sling a knob to protect the move at the end of the left traverse. Pull up and clip 3rd bolt. Continue with bolts and gear. After the 5th bolt go straight up and right on knobs. The bolt you see on the arete to the left is for Acapulco. The 6th bolt is shown as a 2 bolt anchor in the ‘06 Falcon guide but it’s now a single bolt. Don\\'t belay here. Pull up and place an offset in the roof before climbing up and right to clip a pin. Continue up to the roof and good gear. Exit left to the 2 bolt ASCA anchor.(5.10++)',\n",

       "  'description': 'This route climbs unique, ledgey features for three long pitches.  It is recommended that you go uphill a bit and scope out the two, small, right-facing dihedrals that are part of the first pitch.  Also, it is helpful to spot the V-shaped groove with a lone pine tree at it\\'s top which marks the end of the last pitch.    Pitch 1 - start about 50 feet right of Euro Trash and follow big, easy ledges up and right to a small right-facing dihedral.  Place pro and climb to the top of the dihedral.  Climb past two closely-spaced bolts(5.6) then up and slightly left for about 30-40\\' before traversing straight right back to another small right-facing dihedral and belay(#.5 Camalot, #1 Camalot, small stopper).    Pitch 2 - climb up to a bolt then go a bit right(5.7) and up to a big ledge.  The pitch goes more or less straight up, but you will need to zig zag back and forth to link up small ledge systems to get pro and keep the grade moderate. You will find a second bolt about 150\\' up.  From there traverse up and right and belay at a small crack system/ledge(#3 Camalot, 1/2\" cam, small stopper).    Pitch 3 - climb up and left on small ledges for 30\\' to a bolt.  Head up right then left to a second bolt.  Now, head up and right to a third bolt.  Climb up right(5.8) and then left into a groove. Continue up the groove for about 100\\' to the top.    The last pitch of this climb provides a nice, moderate finish to Euro Trash.',\n",

It climbs up the blank low-angle face to the left of the White Slab route (a 5.4 up the prominent left facing arching corner). The few difficult sections on the climb are fairly well protected, but expect runouts on 5.6 and easier terrain.    Pitch 1 heads straight up the low angle slab to a high first bolt. A horizontal crack provides more pro (either .5-.75\" or a 3\" cam works good) and then a second bolt protects the steeper 5.7/5.8 terrain before the anchor.    Pitch 2 has the crux right off the anchor but it felt a little light for 5.9. After smearing up and left to the first bolt the angle lessens and the rest of the pitch is a cruise. This pitch is supposed to have 3 bolts but I must have missed one. In any case there\\'s good natural gear on the upper half of the pitch and then a 5.6 runout to the anchor.    Pitch 3 climbs straight up off the belay past one bolt and then more runout easy friction to the big ledge.    Rappel the route with 2 ropes. It\\'s too bad the anchors are not in different locations because this climb would be better if you could do it in 2 long pitches and then descend with 2 long rappels.',\n",

       "  'description': \"This route includes gear-protected crack climbing, bolt protected face climbing and a fun roof. \\xa0The first two pitches are a great place for leaders getting into trad climbing to practice placing gear.  Pitch 1 - head up and slightly left on a short headwall and gain a crack which runs up the face. Climb this crack for about 30 feet then traverse right into another crack which runs longer up the face. Follow this crack for about 100' to the belay which takes a #2 and #3 Camalot. This pitch is about 215' so if you have a 60m rope you will need to simulclimb with the follower on easy terrain. 5.6.  Pitch 2 - work up and left into a left facing dihedral which turns into a roof. Surmount the roof on nice holds and proceed left to a ledge and belay(#1 Camalot and other gear). 5.5.  Pitch 3 - climb up and left following a small crack for 20 feet to the base of a dark water streak. Climb the water streak past seven bolts with the crux coming at the top. Two bolt anchor. Some gear placements can be found to supplement the bolts, if desired. 5.7.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Tuolumne is not a destination for flawless crack climbs, but there are a few notable exceptions, Blues Riff being one of them.  This pitch would be classic no matter where it would be.  Originally rated 5.11d, it has since been down-rated to as low as 5.11b, but although the crux is brief, it is probably solid 5.11.      Most climb only through the second pitch and then rap with double ropes.      P1: Begin about 100\\' right of the obvious crack system of Phobos at a section of friable rock protected by a new bolt.  This short pitch was changed significantly in recent rockfall, but is still climbable at 5.10c.  Climb up to the first bolt (a small cam helps), then reach left and crank through the roof on large, flexing holds -- be very careful about what you pull on here!  Continue up a short, ugly hand crack to a nice ledge below the second pitch.  Belay from some fixed slings and possibly a #3 Camalot.    P2: Step up onto the face above and ascend it past a bolt to a stance.  Have a few medium wires or finger-size cams ready, and then climb up the finger crack (crux) to an obvious sharp horizontal \"rest\" jug.  Continue up the beautiful thin-hands crack to a final wide section (#3 Camalot) to a bolted anchor.  It is possible to rap from here with two 60m ropes, or one can continue up the wide flake to the summit and walk off.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The counterpart to Phobos, and the other namesake climb of this cliff, Deimos is an excellent steep climb with a lot of hands/fists/OW crack.  It has a bit of a reputation as being hard, burly, and with less than perfect protection.  I found none of these to be particularly true.  The climb is truly a bit atypical for Tuolumne, being more reminiscent of Valley crack climbs with lots of wideness and flares.  But after the first 30 feet, the rock is excellent, there is pro wherever you want it, and the offwidth is pretty tame and easily stemmed or face-climbed around.  Phobos is maybe a slightly better climb (mostly just because of the awesome handcracks), but Deimos is still well worth climbing.    Pitch 1 (5.9, 60 feet): Belay on top of a massive boulder at the base of some stacked blocks leading up to the prominent V-slot roof.  Climb the blocks on good holds to reach the chimney, being careful of loose rock.  Stem and chimney up through the slot to a single tricky move getting up and into the crack above (crux).  Belay at a bad sloping stance shortly after the chimney, or continue higher to a better belay or to link pitches 1 and 2.    Pitch 2 (5.9, 120 feet): This pitch links fairly easily with Pitch 1 if you sling your pro carefully around the roofs.  Climb the slanting ramp/flare, using the wide-hands and offwidth crack in the back.  Arriving underneath the roof, you will find a slung block.  I think this spot would make a far more comfortable belay for Pitch 1 if you don't want to link the first two pitches.  Pass the roof on the left at 5.9 with interesting stems and jams, or undercling out the right at 5.10b.  Ascend the cracks above to an easy chimney, and step left to a good ledge for the belay.    Pitch 3 (5.9, 60 feet): Traverse left across the ledge, then climb the obvious large flakes to the summit, past a single bolt-protected 5.9 face move.  Belay from summit boulders.\",\n",

This stance is roughly where two dikes intersect to form a cross.  5.4.    P2: Continue up the dike past a bolt and step left to another dike.  Follow this up to a bolted anchor on a big ledge.  5.6.    P3: Follow the dike up past three bolts to another bolted anchor.  5.7.    P4: Continue upwards past a pair of bolts (old anchor) and then run it out on 5.8 terrain up to a steep bulge.  Pull this bulge on good holds and continue relatively straight up to a thank-god bolt.  This bolt is hard to spot -- it's pretty much straight up, perhaps slightly to the right of the last belay, but don't stray too far in that direction.  After clipping this bolt there is a stretch of 5.9 (crux) climbing through some gold polish before finally reaching a bolted anchor.    P5: An easy pitch up to a bolted belay below the final headwall.  This can be breached via a wide crack, but most parties rap from here with double ropes (follow the Needle Spoon route on the descent).\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Zee Tree Route is a well-bolted face climb located to the right of the Dike route and ascends an independent line for 3 pitches, after which it joins House Calls and Boche-Dope in a left facing book which leads to the base of the crack pitch of the Dike Route.    The climbing is fairly varied. The first pitch, which is the most interesting, starts at a two bolt anchor just where the angle steepens and ascends a short slightly steep section of knobs (2 bolts with old leeper-style hangers), crosses glacier polish (2 bolts) to a miniature roof. Step over the roof (1 bolt) and pass a small tree growing in a solution pocket (Zee Tree). The pitch originally ended at the tree, but to reduce impact on the fragile tree, the route now passes the tree on the right and ascends (5 bolts) to a comfortable stance and a two bolt anchor. This pitch is a full 165 feet.    The angle slackens above and the climbing eases as well. The second pitch is easy (5.5?) face climbing past 3 bolts to a another two bolt anchor. The final pitch is also easy face climbing , though interesting as the angle varies. It heads up and right past 2 bolts, then straight up and ends in a left facing book. This belay requires gear, medium nuts to medium friends.    To exit, climb up the left facing book and belay near the base of the crack pitch on the Dike Route. Either climb this crack (pro to #4 friend) and rappel the east end of Pywiak, or walk off to the west (not recommended).   :     The route was put up in good style. A mix of eighteen 5/16 and 3/8 inch bolts were placed by hand, on lead, from the ground up, though not in a continuous push. Two others were \"filled in\" while seconding after leading though originally, to eliminate uncharacteristic runout sections.',\n",

The first pitch of this route is covered in the 2nd edtion of the SuperTopo Tuolumne book; however, the climb continues on for two more pitches. While there is nothing on this route that qualifies as 'R', there is a fair bit of 5.7/5.8 climbing 10-15 feet above bolts and further distance on easier climbing.    Pitch one: Friction up past three bolts to a small, left angling ledge. Traverse the ledge and then climb up past two bolts. Continue upwards to a roof and a gear placement. Pull over the small roof and continue past one more bolt to a two bolt anchor (5.8; 160 feet).    Pitch two: Friction and smedge 12-15 feet up from the belay (5.7/5.8) to the first bolt. Continue past several more bolts to a small circular flake region that takes gear. Then continue up and gradually left, past several more well spaced bolts to a large right facing corner. Gear is available here and climbing to the top of the short corner gains a nice ledge and a two bolt anchor (5.9; 120 feet).    Pitch three: Climb up and right 15 feet from the belay to the first bolt. Clip two more bolts as you surmount a small roof and continue knob climbing to a right trending (dirty) ramp.

       "  'description': \"Flash of the Blade climbs fantastic knobs and edges up the center of Razor Back. The climbing is runout in sections, but there is protection whenever you really want it. Both my partners and I agreed that this was a really excellent route; Bryan and Linda did a fine job of linking features on a really nice section of rock. The name of the route is a reference to the Iron Maiden song of the same name.    I listed this route as an 'R' rated climb, but there is no 'R' climbing at the grade of the route. Expect 15-20 foot runouts on 5.8/5.9 climbing (with clean falls) and a couple of 20-25 foot runouts on 5.6/5.7 climbing (with ground or hard slab landing falls).    Pitch one: Climb 25 feet up to the first bolt; there is some 5.7 climbing in this section. Next climb straight up to an obvious gear placement and begin traversing to the right. After 10-15 feet, you will reach a bolt. Now climb up past 4 more bolts (10a) to a two bolt anchor. There is a 15-20 foot runout on 5.9 ish climbing in this section. The rock quality and climbing on this section is fantastic. (10a; 105 feet).    Pitch two: Step right off of the belay and pull up onto a flake/hanging slab and climb amazing 5.6 knobs for 20-25 feet to the top of the flake and your first piece of pro (gear). Next follow 4 bolts up through beautiful, semi-runout smedging on great rock to a two bolt anchor. (5.9; 95 feet)    Pitch three: Climb up off of the belay and climb upwards past 4 bolts (10a). At the fourth bolt, head right towards a right trending flake/ramp and another bolt. Follow the flake upwards; you can get some small cams or nuts in the flake if you like, however the climbing is solid and moderate (maybe 5.5) and most will forgo the gear. Following the ramp, head up past two more spaced bolts (5.9) to a two bolt anchor. (10a; 105 feet).\",\n",

       "  'description': 'I am submitting the pitch that is in the newest guidebook for the area. However, one of the FA informed me that the route extends for two more pitches. I am only including the first pitch (which I have climbed), but I note my understanding of the grades of the next two pitches. If you are more informed than me, please drop me a comment.    Pitch one: Climb 25 feet of great, easy knobs to the first bolt. Next, friction left and a bit upwards for 10-12 feet and look up at the next 100+ feet of sustained smeding and friction (5.10+). Awesome. The bolt line will lead you towards a tree (try to minimize your use of this poor guy) and mantel to a nice ledge with a two bolt anchor (12 bolts; 140 feet).    The next two pitches are mixed bolts and gear.  Pitch two leaves the belay heading up and left on a ramp system and is 5.11. The third pitch is 5.10.',\n",

       "  'name': 'Cathedral Range Traverse',\n",
       "  'description': 'This route makes a circular path along the ridge and across the peaks overlooking Budd Lake, on the south side of Tuolumne Meadows in Yosemite National Park -->    Just hiking (or running) on that ridge for so long with wonderful views in both directions would be great. Even more, it includes some great narrow / arete sections, also some fun climbing peaks which might be too short to justify as an outing individually -- and optionally access to some famous routes (for those who have the speed + endurance + skill to include them).     Actually this route does not include anything like the whole geographical Cathedral Range as shown on maps -- just the northwestern section, which is most accessible to trailheads on highway rt 120, and has lots of fun and spectacular climbing.    Peaks along the way are:      Best climbing - sections with the best climbing are:   . . . offers amazing narrow ridge structures (5.8 or 5.7)   . . . [5.6] offers much more climbing and more interesting).      All latitude/longitude points given below, also other helpful waypoints and tracks, are in a GPX file linked from       Most of the individual peaks were climbed by the 1930s. People were doing the Traverse at least by the 1980s. John Moynier + Claude Fiddler described it (with much less detail than here) in 1993 in , and again in the second edition,  (Falcon.com 2002). Peter Croft described the Cathedral Range traverse (in the opposite direction) in his high Sierra guidebook,  (MaximusPress.com 2002).      Start and finish at the Cathedral Lakes trailhead on route 120 is the simple short way.   For a shorter traverse (or to allow more time for optional Matthes Crest section or Cathedral SE Buttress climb) could ...      For a more difficult traverse:    . . . [5.6] for the normal route around the E side to the NW face.   . . . and traverse it partway (or fully?) toward its N end, then join CRT at Echo Ridge.       Trailhead is at Cathedral Lakes trail (shuttle bus stop) on Tioga Pass highway rt 120 in Tuolumne Meadows. (GPS latitude/longitude approximately N37.8729 W119.3829) (altitude approx 8580ft / 2615meters). About 8.7Miles / 14km west on route 120 from Yosemite National Park east entrance at Tioga Pass.    The plan is first get to Budd Lake, then to the base of the Unicorn climb ...    (1) Start on the Cathedral Lakes trail and go SW about 0.35Mile / 550meter distance, uphill vertical +260ft / +80m) to point (GPS lat/long ~ N37.8693 W119.3867) (altitude ~ 8840ft/2695m)    (2) There turn Left off the main trail (no sign or marking) onto a well-beaten path about two feet wide which starts gentle down, then flat + up a little, then steeper down (then a longer up).    Normally this turn is blocked by one of more logs. It comes about 200ft/70m after the main trail trail curved S up steepish - just after the main trail had curved W up steepish for about 200ft/70m - (and just before the main trail curves W up steepish yet again). Note: The southern endpoint of this second trail is Cathedral Peak, not Budd Lake.    Go roughly S about 0.6Mi / 1000m close to Budd Creek with some ups and downs. Next the trail goes onto a long + wide rock slab area, and at the same time slowly curves to the right - SSW - away from Budd Creek. It\\'s true that one branch of Budd Creek runs down from Budd Lake, but if you try to stay close to this creek, you\\'ll soon be off the trail bushwacking (which is doable and perhaps fun, but more work and time) - and if you follow the obvious east branch, you won\\'t even go to Budd Lake. It\\'s easy to miss the trail here on the slab. The key is to recognize is that the trail often runs between two parallel lines of rocks, with the individual rocks spaced about 3-6ft / 1-2m apart -- and be on the lookout for when those lines curve Right. The slab ends after about 0.25Mi/400m. About another 0.1Mi / 120m there is a move up R on rock, and continue on the dirt trail for another 0.3Mi / 500m to key turn-off point (lat/long ~ N37.8527 W119.3936) (altitude 9540ft / 2910m). This is about 1.0Mi / 1600m from leaving the main Cathedral Lakes trail (with overall gentle uphill of +700ft / +215m).    This turn-off point comes after the Cathedral Peak trail comes in sight of a little creek below its L side, and hooks R around the end of a big fallen tree, then goes gentle down curving L, then roughly flat a short ways aiming straight at a tree. There it\\'s easy to see the Budd Lake trail going off to the L - (At that point the Cathedral Peak trail turns half-R and goes uphill away from the creek.)     (3) Here turn L (SE) off the Cathedral Peak trail (no sign or marking) and cross a small creek on broken logs. This turn is easy to miss. It is often blocked by one or more logs along the side of the Cathedral Peak trail.    This little creek is the west branch of Budd Creek, and the unofficial trail to Budd Lake basically follows this creek. So immediately after crossing the creek, turn R (SW) and start hiking on this (narrower) trail to go generally SSW about 0.7Mi / 1100m (with overall gentle uphill of +460ft / +140m) to the outlet of Budd Lake    (lat/long ~ N37.8431 W119.3973) (alt 10000ft/3050m).    (4) Next objective is to get to the base of the N-NW face of Unicorn Peak.   Go SE (on the E side of Budd Lake) about 0.35Mi / 600m, aiming for a col/saddle above a rock slab slope. The slab is steep-ish, likely requires some wide zig-zags to get up - (wouldn\\'t want to have to come  this when wet).    From the col (10290ft / 3135m), see Unicorn peak to the East across a wide bowl. Go down a little SE, then contour around the bowl, E about 0.3Mi / 500m E, then N about 0.35Mi / 600m to reach a flat/gentle area under the W face of Unicorn Peak.   (lat/long ~ N37.8452 W119.3841) (alt 10270ft/3130m).    Total distance from trailhead about 3.1Mi / 5km, with a total vertical gain about +1840ft / +560m (including some ups + downs).    . . .     high point is the North summit (lat/long ~ N37.8457 W119.3821) (alt ~ 10830ft/3300m). From the E side of the Unicorn, hike upward diagonally around to reach the bottom of the rock of the NNW face. Then climb the rock up to the notch between the north peak and middle peak of the Unicorn -- or aiming for some point between the north summit and the notch. Interesting climbing, and it might be possible to find a way to do this all at the grade of class 4, but it\\'s sustained and not short, so it would not be surprising if some class 5 moves will be encountered.    . . (Alternate way to this notch: Climb the slabs of the W face of the ridge S from the Unicorn toward the talus heap (\"Althuski\"), then go N along the broad ridge.)    Getting from the notch to the N summit is traditionally graded class 4, but one usual way includes an exposed overhanging move (positive holds) - which many people might grade as class 5.   . . (The notch can be reached more easily from the E side from the Lake Elizabeth trailhead, but that requires a car/bus shuttle, and misses out on some interesting climbing.)    Come back down off the N summit the same way. Could also tag some of the other (easier) summits. Or there are some interesting moves along the narrow ridge going south from some of the other Unicorn summits. More interesting if stay more directly on the arete where possible. More exposure to play with if make some moves on the W side.    Next go easy 0.3Mi / 500m S on the broad ridge to the next high spot, sometimes called \"Althuski\" (lat/long ~ N37.8411 W119.3800) (alt ~ 10875ft/3315m). It\\'s a heap of big granite rocks -- fun if you like descending from its top by hopping from rock to rock. Otherwise can be bypassed on its W side.    (lat/long ~ N37.8356 W119.3847) (alt ~ 11060ft/3370m) is about 0.4Mi / 620m SW from the rock heap, but it\\'s more complicated to get there. The easy way to climb the Cockscomb is on its W face -- which is most easily reached by going around its S side ... Perhaps leave the Cockscomb NE ridge fairly early, then horizontal across dirt until fully around the base of the SW end of the peak. - (? a more aesthetic way might be to stay closer to the NE ridge and aim for the notch between the N and S halves of the Cockscomb ? see    . . Other folks report going around the N side of the Cockscomb, or climbing it by its NW face -- or even traversing the peak by its E face and W face (some did not like rock quality on W face).    Descend W to the Cockscomb-Echo col (alt ~ 10660ft/3250m).   . . (If need to retreat from here in wet weather, note that between this pass and Budd Lake are two large steep-ish rock slabs to be descended (slippery?). So consider instead first going down SW then around the S and W sides of the Echo Peaks.)    is optional, but the rock structures on the arete are so interesting (especially the section north from the North summit) that it\\'s tempting to visit it somehow. Several options for embracing or avoiding different sections of the Matthes ridge. See    description and Comments - also    - also Comments on the     - W summit is higher (lat/long ~ N37.8348 W119.3959) (alt ~ 11150ft/3400m) than E summit - (also higher than Cathedral Peak). The upper section of the East arete has wonderful knife-edge sections. Many people grade it as class 4, but might be a low class 5 down-climb move off the E summit.    . . (For maximum fun climbing, try to spend as much time as possible directly on the top of the ridge - \"balls over the razor\" - or make moves across from one side to the other - or look for chances to climb on the steeper side.)   We saw a report that it might be possible to start by climbing somewhere on the N face of the E ridge.    After the high point of Echo Ridge can find some additional narrow arete moves on the West arete a bit lower.    Gentle down to Wilts Col (lat/long ~ N37.8343 W119.4007) (alt ~ 10760ft/3280m) - between Echo Peak 8 at the N end of the east group of Echo Peaks, and Echo Peak 7 at the NE end of the middle group of Echo Peaks.   . . (If need to exit now from this Traverse, it\\'s maximum class 2 from Wilks Col down to Budd Lake and out the trail to the highway 120.)    are numbered 1 to 9, in three groups:    (1) Echo Peaks 1 to 4 form a N-S line on the West, and the arete across peaks 1 to 4 is overall narrow and in some sections knife-edge;    (2) peaks 5 to 7 are the Middle group;    (3) peaks 8 + 9 are the line on the East - (Peak 9 is the most difficult summit to reach).   . . For more on climbing Echo Peaks + Ridge, see R.J.Secor guidebook,  (Mountaineers 2009)    Tallest of all the \"Echos\" is Peak 3 (lat/long ~ N37.8327 W119.4034) (alt ~ 11100ft/3385m) - so the easy fun accomplishment is to get to the summit of high peak 3, and also traverse the narrow arete line between peaks 1 + 2 + 3. The obvious easy way on or off that line is the E side of the col between 1 + 2. From Wilts Col the easy way to get there is to traverse low around the N side of peak 7 and peak 5.    Next a short way to Cathedral Peak is by down-climbing the W side of the col between peak 3 and peak 2. The top section is fun scrambling, but lower down the rock gets loose and with dirt. An obvious way (with less loose rock) is to return to Wilts Col and go N down (on dirt) from there. Another possible short way (not checked by us) is to return to the col between Echo 1 and Echo 5, and go directly N down from there.   . . (If need to exit now from this Traverse, it\\'s non-difficult cross-country travel from Wilts Col to Budd Lake, or from W side of peaks 1-2-3 to hit the trail N below Budd Lake.)    Next hike/run cross-country N about 1 mile / 1700m to the southeast base of the summit cliffs of Cathedral Peak. Likely it\\'s easier to aim a bit east of the cliffs, to hit the normal trail (improved with stone steps) to Cathedral Peak, and finish on that.    (lat/long ~ N37.8478 W119.4055) (alt 10912ft/3326m) has a great summit block with a great view, no matter how you get there. A very attractive option is to climb the much more difficult  [5.6] to the summit of Cathedral Peak - (the usual start for that route is 100-125ft / 30-40m W along the base of the cliff from where the hiking trail meets the cliff.)    The normal route to the summit goes up the trail around E side of the summit cliffs. This trail now has stone steps. It stays pretty close to the base of the cliffs along the E side, at first N, then curves NW. After about 0.15Mi / 230m distance with vertical gain of +390ft / +120m it reaches a barrier. For a nice view / snack spot  the difficult + exposed summit climbing, here turn R and go N thru a narrow slot in the rock to a flat spot. To continue to the summit, scramble up about 25ft diagonal Left, then horizontal Left (W) around the N corner of the summit cliffs, past some bushes to wide ledge on the NE side of the NW face.   . (For a more interesting adventure, do not read the following instructions, instead figure it out for yourself, like John Muir when he was here first in 1869) ...  : Next climb the NW face, likely with some zigzags (many people find it easiest to go all the way over to the SW side), finishing (50-80ft higher) at the NE side of the face. Next diagonal up Right to a notch, and cross the notch to the S face. Traverse horizontally SE about 10ft to the bottom of twin cracks. Climb up those about 12ft to the SW side of the summit block, then to the flat top for a great view.      From the summit of Cathedral Peak, return the same way ... down the twin cracks, across to and down the NW face, around the N corner, and down the E side to the southeast base of cliff. Next down the unofficial Cathedral Peak trail, first steep-ish SE, soon curves NE gentler, later NNE (careful not to lose the trail while on the wide long slab) to meet the official Cathedral Lakes trail. Finally NE down on that back to the trailhead on highway rt 120. (descent distance 2.7 miles / 4.4 km).      see photos for other MountainProject routes ...     . All latitude/longitude points above, also other helpful waypoints and tracks, are in a GPX file linked from    . But they\\'re given mainly for planning + reference. This is a \"friendly\" area for wilderness navigation with a map (and compass). For experienced parties using the detailed instructions above, carrying a GPS device should not be necessary for navigating the approach + route in good weather.',\n",

       "  'description': \"The only thing better than the spectacular Matthes Crest traverse is to link it up with two other classic Tuolumne cruiser routes, the NW Buttress of Tenaya Peak and the SE Buttress of Cathedral Peak.  You also get a sampling of what Tuolumne has to offer, from smooth slabs to wildly exposed knobby fins to choose-your-own adventure crack climbing. These three peaks form an obvious circuit from Tenaya Lake and make a great outing for any Tuolumne enthusiast.  Many options exist for extending the link-up if you haven't gotten your fill.      Note that this route holds snow so it's best to avoid it until dry. The route is shaded in the morning so plan accordingly. There isn't a direct trail from the Tenaya Lake parking lot so either take the trail to the lake until you find the one that heads back NE or trample the meadow and cross-country through the trees toward the left-hand side of Tenaya Peak.  You are aiming for the shrubby ledge system to the left of the route.  As of June 2012 the trail was well worn and cairned.      Supertopo has a blow-by-blow description of the route, but you can just as easily follow the crack systems up the obvious buttress. The route eases you into the steeper, more difficult climbing up higher. Several summit options exist of varying difficulty, including a 5.7ish hand crack and a 4th class option out right. The true summit is southwest of where you'll top out.      From the summit of Tenaya Peak head east between Tressider Peak and Columbia Finger then southeast after crossing the Cathedral Lakes trail to reach the southern end of Matthes Crest.  You'll be able to see  from the Tenaya Peak summit as a bearing point.     It's 2.5 miles as the crow flies and the only place you will likely follow a trail is the final ascent up to the  that marks the start of Matthes.    From the golden boulder choose a line up the knobby crack systems that lead to the ridgeline proper (5.5).  The ridgeline is mostly class 3-4.  If it seems too hard look off to the sides; there is usually an easier ramp down below.  For soloists the easiest way off the south summit is to head back in the direction you came until you can   on the east side of the  can also do a more direct downclimb at 5.7. From here traverse north into the notch that divides the summits.    From the notch mantle onto the ledges until you reach the leftward trending diagonal crack (5.7) which is the official  of the route. Alternate: 5.8 corner offwidth  From here climb the 5.4 chimney on the left side of the ledge to the north summit.    Don't stop now. Continue on for more class 4 to low fifth class exposed fun.  The final tower provides another short section of exposed 5.7 if you wish to partake. If not, you can downclimb off the west side (class 3-4) just prior to the second to the last tower.      From the end of Matthes Crest work your to  to Cathedral's SE Buttress (~1.6 miles as the crow flies).  The most direct route is to aim for notch between Echo Ridge and Echo Peaks (left side of Echo Ridge).  There are multiple routes up the SE Buttress. Refer to Supertopo if you need specifics.  The most recent edition now includes the full traverse.      Echo Ridge (class 4), Echo Peaks (class 3 to 5.7), Eichorn Pinnacle (5.4)      From the top of Cathedral downclimb the 4th class summit blocks to reach the class 3 ledge system.  If you are heading back to the Cathedral Lakes trailhead you will want the high saddle to the NE that leads to the trail that skirts the east side of Cathedral Peak.  If you are heading directly back to Tenaya Lake  slabs/scree and through swamplands to the southern side of the main Cathedral Lake.  You'll find a footpath along the shoreline.  From the western end of the lake follow the drainage down slabs and cobbled river beds toward Tenaya Lake.  I did notice a faint trail in certain section of the drainage but I gave up trying to follow it since it didn't really seem to offer any advantage over going straight down the drainage.  About 1.5 trail miles from the lake you'll come across a bridge that leads to a good trail back to the lake and your car.  The direct line mileage for the entire descent is ~2.7.      Availability of water will vary. In late season the seasonal streams between Tenaya and Matthes may dry up and require a detour to the lakes. The northern slopes below Echo Ridge/Peaks, however, tend to hold snow later and are a more reliable source.  Worst case you can detour to one of the lakes.\",\n",

Once at the small roof, continue straight up that crack all the way to the summit. The entire route overhangs about 8 feet from the base.     The crack gradually widens from 1\" at the small roof to 7\" at the very top. The hand and fist jams are solid and are deep in the flaring slot, while awkward, it provides good rests. The offwidth section is also rounded over and slightly flaring making it tough to get deep enough for solid arm bars, and slightly too flared for good chicken wings, making it quite relentless between rest stances. Irregularities in the width of the upper half of the offwidth make pushing a cam the whole way impractical, so I recommend two #6 cams.    Does anyone have any information on any route history?',\n",

The rock quality is good but not great--as of 2010 (3 years after the FA) the route needs some more traffic to break off the most fragile crystals. Lots of edging on knobs for feet, so wear your stiffest shoes.    The topo in the Supertopo guidebook is accurate and easy to follow. (We forgot to bring ours and had a bit of an adventure; the rock quality tends to be poor off route.)     The climb is closer to Narsil than it appears on the topo. The slings at the top of Narsil are just barely visible from the right edge of the Anduril belay ledge (as of 2010 they are red, making them easier to spot).    The Supertopo rates the 1st pitch crux as 10b. It is a very tightly bolted roof, with a bolt immediately below and above; anyone taller than 5\\'2\" or so can clip the bolt above before getting over the roof. Slightly soft for Yosemite 10b--definitely not an old-school sandbag.     The Supertopo calls a short (vegetated) section on the 2nd pitch \"flaring hands,\" and rates it 10a. It\\'s noticeably easier than an old-school sandbagged Yosemite 5.9 (e.g., Phobos/Deimos, Reeds Direct).

       "  'description': \"Approach Time: 2-3 hours   Descent Time: 2-3 hours   Time to climb the route: 3-6 hours   Sun Exposure: sunrise to late afternoon   Height of route: ~500', length 1/2 mile to North Summit or 0.8 miles to the end.    Generally, people do the traverse from South to North. This is because the crest slopes upwards in that direction and therefore you will end up at a higher elevation. Doing it North to South would involve more downclimbing.    Probably best to Simul or Solo much of the route.  To rope up for every single pitch would take a horrendous amount of time.    Start the climb at the South face above a patch of pine trees and stay a bit left. The climbing is <5.6 here and climbs very textured / featured rock upwards onto the ridge. Follow the path of least resistance. Once on the crest itself, just follow it along. When in doubt, check out both sides of the crest and traverse along the easier one. The crux of the climb comes on the left side (West) of the crest directly below the South Summit. Strenuous and physical climbing up a good crack leads to easier climbing and then the summit. Sign the register.    From the South Summit: Do not rap, but rather climb back down the ridgetop for 100' and traverse past on easy ledges on the East side of the South Summit. Trying to rap often results in snagged ropes here.    OR   Simply continue the traverse and downclimb the next section, placing pro for the follower.    Down into the notch between the two summits, then some 5.7 moves to get up onto the (higher) North summit.    Some parties stop at the notch between the two summits and rappel down the very wide gully on the west side of the notch, straightforward with a single 60-meter rope. There are rock horns along the south side (descender's left). Might be slings/cord already in place, but safer to bring your own webbing/cord material and rappel rings.     From the North Summit: Many parties stop here and rappel off the crest. Two double-rope rappels on the West side is easiest, but many parties have done it by three or four rappels with a single 60-meter rope -- see Comments on the route ).     Some of the rappels are on natural anchors, so bring some webbing/sling/cord (and rappel rings) in case the stations need new webbing.    Continuing the climb offers great climbing, but the climbing difficulty increases so it is recommended you be solid at the grade.  I'd say some of the downclimbing was 5.8.    Retreat:   It is probably best to bail off the West side at just about any point.  There appear to be many rap stations at random intervals on the face.  Multiple short rappels are best.  Be prepared to leave slings and or gear.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Amazing narrow fin of granite, above an ocean of granite. Variety of interesting moves, unfogettable rock structures, sustained for more than a thousand feet of climbing.    More interesting and narrow than the South ridge (which is what most roped parties do and call the \"traverse\" of the Matthes Crest). Said by some long-time Sierra climbers to be their favorite ridge traverse. More ... is it the best moderate ridge in USA?    . (All latitude/longitude points given below, also other helpful waypoints and tracks, are in a GPX file linked from    )    At least one of the 5.8 sections can be avoided, and much of the reputation of difficulty comes from people trying this ridge in the downward direction. So someone  find some navigation in the upward direction which keeps all the difficulty at 5.7 or less. Look forward to seeing experiences about this in the Comments.   :   Starting from the Cathedral Lakes trailhead on Tioga Pass highway route 120 (GPS latitude/longitude approx N37.8729 W119.3829) (altitude ~ 2615m). Follow the Approach instructions for the    as far as the N end of Budd Lake (lat/long ~ N37.8431 W119.3973) (altitude ~ 3050m).    From the N end of Budd Lake, hike SSW about 0.6mile/1000meters up toward the Echo Peaks, which are west of the broad Echo Ridge, which is west of the Cockscomb peak and the Echo-Cockscomb col. The objective is to cross \"Wilts col\" (lat/long ~ N37.8343 W119.4007) (alt ~ 3280m), which is between the East group of the Echo Peaks and the Middle group of the Echo Peaks. Actually for much of the approach you can\\'t see the East group, so perhaps just aim for the obvious wide steep dirt/scree gully facing north which is to the left of the (visible) Echo Peaks. This slope often has a zig-zag track, or snow in springtime).    Next (instead of continuing over and down the other side of \"Wilts Col\") turn Left (East) and hike gently up about 100 yards/meters to go around the N side of Echo Peak 8, then diagonal down SouthEast about 100 yards/meters between Echo Peaks 8+9 and Echo Ridge, then horizontal traverse East about 0.2mile / 300 meters on big talus under the south side of Echo Ridge and so reach the north end (N37.8333 W119.3944) of the North ridge of Matthes Crest.    . . (or could save a little distance by finishing diagonal SE and scramblingup onto the crest of the North ridge farther south closer to the mini-towers.)    Walk S on the ridge about 500m mostly flat, perhaps some scrambling moves. Meet some big \"pancake\" rocks, then the North mini-tower (lat/long ~ N37.8269 W119.3958) (altitude ~ 3225m).   : First do one or more peaks of the     : First do the beginning of the    :    Overall the north ridge has four sections ... from N to S:      Some of the more difficult moves are:     : Up the North end of the N mini-tower, belay near its summit. Crux move not more than 5.6 in upward direction (one party used #2 Camalot to protect), but might feel like 5.7 going down, more intimidating not knowing what it\\'s leading to below. Traverse a little near the summit then find a way down the South end into the notch between the two mini-towers. One party tried the E side (not more than 5.6) and protected with cams up to #1 Camalot and a couple of long slings around protrusions -- careful, at least one flake with obvious slot behind it seems a big suspect). Possible belay stance could be at flake below E side of notch.    North end of South mini-tower looks pretty difficult to take directly. Easier to first traverse around to its W side, perhaps after dropping down 10 feet below notch, then rising traverse on narrow ledges (one party protected with smaller cams). Then choose where to switch to climbing upward to the crest -- at least three different options -- what looks to be most protectable is to aim for the straight-up crack which finishes roughly at the summmit (width range 1-2 inches, took standard protection fairly well, difficulty around 5.7-5.8). (for those traveling S->N, getting  this NW side could seem more intimidating - see ideas in Comments). Belay anchor rock horns near summit. Getting down the South end of South mini-tower is not as difficult.    One guidebook seems to imply that most parties should plan on just skipping the mini-towers (see Variations 1 and 2 below). This is assuming they are going in the S->N direction (which seems more difficult and intimidating through the mini-towers). Also roped parties will find the mini-towers slow because it makes sense to set up belays both near the two summits and in the notches. And many roped parties traversing in S->N direction are getting low on time and energy by the time they reach the mini-towers.    But the mini-towers are key parts of what makes the Matthes Crest such a remarkably great climb, so it\\'s worth at least taking a \"nibble\" on them -- especially parties going in the N->S direction. Parties going S->N might consider tagging the summit of the South mini-tower, then returning to the notch at its South end, then use Variation 1 below to pass around their W side to the N end of the N mini-tower, then climb the N mini-tower up and back before finishing easily to the end of N ridge.   : It\\'s possible to avoid both mini-towers by going below on their West side. In the N->S direction, see an obvious non-narrow ledge system roughly horizontal and walk S on that, then when roughly under the notch at S end of S mini-tower, go upward to reach the crest, with some thoughtful moves and zig-zagging to keep the difficulty at class 3.    In the S->N direction, from near the notch by the S end of South mini-tower, start down W side, at first diagonal down back S a little ways, then traverse 10-15 feet north, then down a wide vertical crack with positive holds inside or nearby to reach non-narrow ledge system, and walk North on that.    is an alternative which more completely avoids both mini-towers, and perhaps make the approach or return a little easier. See under Comments below for details.     section: About a thousand feet with lots of fun non-difficult narrow-arete-traverse moves, but also some thoughtful vertical \"steps\" about 10-15 ft each (easier to figure out in the upward N->S direction).   : One of the \"steps\" leads to a slightly-overhanging traverse section on the E face about 10-15ft wide, with about a hundred feet of open air underneath. Felt around 5.8, don\\'t know about protection - (hopefully we\\'ll start seeing some detailed guidance for that below in the Comments). Anyway it\\'s    . . avoidable: Go down the gully on W side about 20ft, a couple of thoughtful moves up out of S side of gully, then diagonal SE up to crest.   : Most parties get up to (or down from) the North summit by climbing close to the arete. The East and West sides have different styles of climbing moves and protection possibilities. Key sequence by bottom of arete has stemming and jamming moves, around 5.7 (but those lacking solid jamming technique will find it harder, and soloists should feel very confident in their jamming to take this on). Hand-size cam is useful for protection, and about half of hand-width for a smaller crack alongside.    Not far north from base of arete, lots of people do a stemming / step-across move over an exciting gap, also mentioned in a modern guidebook - (photos see link further below). But this might be avoidable by going below the crest on the East side.    This N summit is the highest on the Matthes Crest.   :    Rappel down the W side of the N summit. Some recent guidebooks and most websites say that double-ropes are needed for these rappels, but recently some parties have been rappeling down the W side of N summit with a single 60-meter rope (see the Comments below, also ).   : Return back north down the North ridge (for maximum enjoyment of great arete climbing). Could use Variation 1 (or Variation 2) to shorten this.   : Down-climb the SW side of N summit into the notch between the S summit and N summit. Could be tricky doing this on-sight as a down-climb -- some moves will likely feel like 5.7 -- see details in  description and Comments. Also the SuperTopo guidebook has a detailed topo for this section. Then make rappels with a single rope in the gully down the West side of the notch (rock horns on the south side of the gully. Down-climb? Lower section can be down-climbed at 3rd class with a few moves of 4th class. But there\\'s a short upper section with down-sloping holds at 5th class (unless trust a delicate-looking flake?).   : Climb South down the South ridge -- finishes with three or two downward pitches including some 5.5 moves (one guidebook suggests this would be difficult) -- rappel options unknown. For more info see    :   Could just go back over Wilts Col ... but if did one of the rappel descents, then it\\'s less work to instead make a traverse W low under the S side of Echo Peaks, then a rising traverse over a broad shoulder (lat/long ~ N37.8373 W119.4060) (alt ~ 10300ft/3140m) on the W side of Echo Peaks. Then down toward Budd Lake - or a little shorter is to aim for a bit R (E) of Cathedral Peak, go gently down until meet the unofficial Cathedral Peak trail, down on that and it joins the Approach route.

Interesting climbing to reach the highest N summit, but pretty short compared to the approach (shortest from the East side).     Difficulty of the N summit traditionally rated class 4, but one obvious way of doing it has a slightly overhanging (or at least fully vertical) move with exposure to a deadly fall - seems more like class 5.   . (If you\\'re more of a scrambler than a serious rock-climber ... unless you\\'re partnered with someone with a rope who knows how to use it for protection ... better to plan toward getting only the Middle summit, perhaps along with the higher mountain less than half a mile south along the same ridge as the Unicorn.)   : Trailhead is at Tuolumne Meadows campground (along S side of highway 120 about 8 miles W from the Yosemite N.P. east entrance at Tioga Pass) near group camp, the B loop. Bear-proof boxes for day-hiker food storage.    Take the Elizabeth Lake trail South about 2.3 miles / 3.7 km (with vertical gain 900 ft / 270 meters) to near Elizabeth Lake. Hike / scramble up the East (or NE) slope of the Unicorn to the notch between the middle summit and the north summit (vertical gain approx +1300 ft / 400 meters).   : The highest North summit is close to the notch, so it\\'s tempting to want to \"go for it\", but it\\'s not so easy. One way to get there is to cross over to the W side of the notch, then make an exposed short traverse N. Next up to the crest of the ridge, perhaps a little to its other side, then perhaps a delicate move up, and on to the summit. Before committing to any move, keep in mind you\\'ll have to do it again on the way back.    Middle summit is easier climbing and less exposed.   : Return the same way.   Some people like to also climb the (higher) hump about 0.3 miles / 500 meters to the South along the broad ridge - which is fun if you like scrambling on big granite talus.   Or to play with additional exposed climbing moves, can find some in traversing the other Unicorn summits and narrow S ridge.   : Total horizontal distance about 2.9 miles / 4.7 km.

Higgins returned in 1973 with Mike Irwin. This route set a very high standard for face climbing style and difficulty in its day.     This route is really nice and one of the longest routes on Fairview. The route essentially follows the northwest nose of Fairview, climbing corners, flakes and cracks connected by runout face sections. An incredible full pitch face traverse right under the main roof allows escape to a bouldery crux face pitch and moderate climbing above to the U-shaped bowl and the summit.     All bolts on this route are excellent, recently replaced by the ASCA except the first one and one at the belay at the start of the traverse as of 2016.',\n",

It happens to be the apex of the ledge system.  5.6    Pitch 9.  Climb past 5 bolts and a bit of gear if wanted.   10a/b    You have finished the route.   Good on ya'll!!!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Stimulating face climbing with an important emphasis on route finding.  Climbs the beautiful apron and crosses the big roof right of the Regular Route.    Pitch 1: Start on the right side of the north face apron, about where the access trail exits the forest.  Head up and left following a steep 3rd class ramp to a belay at an obvious roof and right facing dihedral.  This belay is shared with Wonderful Wino (5.10b R).  If you choose to lead this and we did, some good small cams are available in a thin left facing corner near the end.  Gear belay thin to 1\" - 3rd Class or easy 5th - 200 feet.    Pitch 2:  This great pitch moves up and left from the belay on large knobs, run it out about 30 feet to an obvious thin right facing corner 5.6R and jam some small to medium cams in the bottom.  Continue on ever diminishing knobs left and up past 3 very hard to see bolts.  5.10a friction getting to the 3rd bolt.  From the third bolt, head up and right to a hidden left facing corner more 5.10a friction.  Climb the corner (5.8) and jam all the gear in it you can (tricky thin to 2\").  From the top of the corner move straight left about 30-40 feet onto the slabby face and eventually the roof (whimpering 5.9R).  Good 1\"-3\" cams for gear at roof.  Lieback and stem the roof (5.8) to a huge ledge with a bolted belay.  5.10a - 200 feet - long slings/double ropes help.    Pitch 3: Climb the enjoyable grassy right facing dihedral, past an overlap, until it rolls over to become a roof.  Face climb on big knobs around the right side of the roof.  Immediately traverse 15 feet left on a sloping ledge directly over the roof to a nice belay at a right facing flake.  Gear belay thin to 1\" - 5.8 - 100 feet.    Pitch 4: Traverse straight left 30 feet on a sloping slabby ledge to a vertical thin crack 5.8.  There is no gear on the traverse but the hardest move is the first.  Place small TCU\\'s and small stoppers and climb the thin crack 20 feet to a good fixed stopper and pin 5.9.  Follow this crack up and left to the roof (5.10a) and lieback a finger crack over the roof at a large left facing dihedral.  Once above the roof, follow the dihedral with a finger crack 20 feet, the right arete is super knobby and useful here (5.7).  Place gear and climb around the arete to the face, up and right 20 feet on good knobs to a thin seam for gear (5.8R).  Step down and right to grassy belay area.  Gear belay thin to 3\" - 5.10a - 100 feet.    Pitch 5: Follow the excellent grassy finger crack - left facing dihedral above for 200 feet to a large ledge at the base of the 5.6 ramp pitch of the Regular Route.  Gear belay thin to 3\" - Sustained 5.8 - 200 feet.    Follow the Regular Route (5.7) or Wonderful Wino (5.8) for three pitches and scrambling to the top.',\n",

Pitch 1 & 2 climb cracks just right of the big arch, aim for an obvious small roof in a right facing corner that marks the first belay.  Surmount the fun roof then moderate climbing to the corner.  5.8/5.9    Pitch 3 & 4 climb the corner above, moving onto the face midway through pitch three to avoid the chimney then head back to the corner to belay.  The next pitch goes up the nice corner to the top right side of the pinnacle.  5.7/5.8    Pitch 5 is thin friction and small hold face.  Go down and out right a ways to a bolt.  Just past this is 5.10 face with good swing potential for your second.  Ascend a loose pillar, I placed several micro-nuts here.  The hard face climbing above past two bolts is well protected.  5.10b/c    Pitch 6 is usually wet midway through, but fun liebacking and unclinging is had before the wet and the corner above is stellar.  Plan on aiding on a couple cams to pass the wet.  5.10-    Pitch 7 follow this route up and left aiming for a moderate thin double dihedral then belay at a small tree.  5.8    Pitch 8 with a bolt leads straight out right to a easy ramp.  5.10a briefly    Pitch 9 is a little spooky makes a traverse out right past a loose block, a dihedral 5.8 and over an easy roof to 300' of easy ground.\",\n",

All day sun in June with a few shadier corners in the morning, a.m. shade closer to September.  1.

Heads-up climbing through a small roof above a bolt and couple of pieces of gear is followed by sustained edging between more closely-spaced bolts. 30 m 11a  5. Start up the loose pillar and clip the lone bolt out right avoiding the roofs above. A couple of moves will bring you over to the crescent ledge and easy terrain. Scramble up to the ledge up and right with the bolted anchor. 25 m 10b  6. This pitch is the reason why I suggested an R rating for the otherwise PG route. Move left to the ramp to gain a foot \"ledge\" that will bring you back right to the point above the belay. Do a couple more slabby 5.9 moves (ok feet, but no hands) to clip the first of 2 bolts. You are almost soloing this section since a fall would result in broken legs before the rope will catch you. The difficulty eases slightly when you are about 20\\' above the bolt and almost to the 2nd one. Follow easy cracks to the anchor just below the roofs. 2 bolts and 3-4 pieces. 30 m 11a R  7.

Head up on somewhat low angle terrain with limited opportunities for pro, do a tough step left, then contour up and right and belay on an obvious platform ledge below the beginning of a long left-facing corner system.  5.9.    P2: Continue up on 5.9 climbing to another ledge below a thin finger crack.    P3: Climb up the finger crack past a crux move, and then onwards up a steep, left-leaning crack to a good belay.  5.10d.  I believe there is a 5.9 variation out right near the start that avoids the hard climbing but that it is of lesser quality.    P4: Continue up the steep corner using the crack and knobs.  5.9.    P5:  Perform a somewhat scary underclinging traverse left and around to another corner system and up this to a belay.  5.9.    P6:  Continue in the same system.  The climbing eases with the angle.  5.8\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Route was established ground-up during the summer of '05.  This is definitely an old school style meadows route.   The bolts aren't exactly where you want or need them but where they could be drilled.   Though the hardest move is protected fairly well.  The second pitch is probably the mental crux with only 5 bolts in 200' of sustained 5.10 climbing with one 10+ move way above a bolt.  This pitch might be tad longer than 200' so be ready to simul a small bit or bring a longer rope.      Pitch 4 shares some climbing with an unreported route, Quasimodo,  established by Tom Carter back in the day.  Really fun and exposed pitch.  Pitch 5 holds the hardest technical bits and require solid footwork and mantling ability.  The end of this pitch pulls a really cool roof that Fairest of All traverses underneath.  This actually makes a much better exit for Fairest of All as it avoids the funky and long traverse out right.  Hemispheres could also be exited this way.    Overall this is high quality and extremely engaging route on excellent rock.  Classic Fairview Dome.    Possibly only repeated once by Bob Jensen and Sean Kriletich less than a week after the FA.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This route takes a nice line to the left of the Great Pumpkin.  It is a quasi \"old school\" route designed for the leader who has their lid screwed on pretty tight.  There are some lengthy runouts on easy ground and a spot of routefinding thrown in for good measure.  The knobs are dandy and the polish is mirrorlike.  It is said this route is a better version of the Great Pumpkin.  Maybe give this one a try instead of standing in line over at the Pumpkin.    Pitch #1: Motor up the easy corner and lob in a few cams as you go. There is a bolt at the top of the corner before you start moving right and into a few cruxy moves. Watch out for rope drag. 3 bolts total on the pitch, then a 4 bolt (two that are good) belay.    Pitch #2: Undercling up an left out of the station on some very loose plates. Clip the bolt and begin to move right and up and across the polish. You can stuff some small gear into a flake after you move right and climb up a bit. Eventually get to the right facing corner where you can lob in a nut or some cams. Belay is at the top of this corner. 3 bolts on the pitch, then a 2 bolt belay.    Pitch #3: Run it out straight up to a bolt and then continue moaning upward and slightly right. If you are lucky you will find a small flake that takes 3/4\" to 1\" cams. Continue straight up from this flake until you either hit a rusted 1/4\" bolt or the anchor. 1 good bolt, and 1 bad hidden bolt on the pitch, then a 2 bolt belay.    Pitch #4: Go up toward the big roof and maybe plug in a 1.5\" cam as you turn the corner. Exit the roofs on the right via a 5.4 ramp and look for a fixed pin about half way out. Run the rope all the way back onto the slab to belay. Overlaps up there will take small to medium cams for an anchor. No bolts, set an anchor on top.',\n",

Trend up and left to features that accept gear. Climb up to a stance then up nice knobs past 2 bolts. Another thinner feature above will accept a micronut and protect the moves up and right to another stance and bolt. A 2 bolt anchor equipped with rings is ten feet above that.  Pitch 2: 5.10c, 175 feet. Climb up and left to the obvious rightward trending crack system. Climb it until a fixed pin is reached, then break out onto the face to the left, reach juggy knobs and climb to a good stance above. Climb the bolt protected 10c flake and knobby face. The flake is hollow and detached but solid to climb on.  Pitch 3: 5.11a, 130 feet. Stellar! Climb the easy feature up and left towards the beautiful orange bulge. Clip three bolts while working through the awesome 11a sequence that leads to a right facing corner. Place gear in the top of the corner then climb the face to the left, straight up past another bolt to the anchor.  Pitch 4: 5.10a, 165 feet. Follow three bolts up and left over patina, knobs, and edges. Climb up, placing pro in the two shallow right facing systems. Ignore the old off-route bolt off to the right. Gain the knobs and 3 bolts that guide you up and left to an anchor below the corner/roof/arch.  Pitch 5: 5.9, 165 feet. Climb the right facing corner then step left to steep but good knobs and a bolt. Climb up and trend right over moderate terrain, placing gear in several overlaps as you go. Terrain is 5.7ish but knobs are more friable up here (unlike the generally stellar rock quality of the other pitches). Bolted anchor on stance marks the route's summit.  Great route with some stellar climbing.  All anchors are on good stances or ledges.  A legit Fairview route, expect 5.9R climbing and headgame elements to every pitch. However, all harder climbing is protected.  All hardware is modern, stainless, and bomber.  Enjoy!\",\n",

The 11b crux on pitch 7 involves monkeying on jugs through a roof - a very memorable pitch. Second hardest pitch (pitch 2 at 11a) involves sustained edging and is great for testing your mettle before jumping on the more scantily protected lines as the falls are reasonably safe. The topo is easy to follow. It seemed like everyone I knew climbed the route shortly after the FA (ca. 2009), but it has since fallen into obscurity.

Make crux moves as the crack narrows to tips just before a ledge and the start of the wide left leaning liebacking. Plug in a few pieces and sack up for about 25-30 feet of unprotected liebacking up the crisp corner. (5.9R). Try not to get bucked at the top as the edge becomes rounded and you have to figure out how to get into the chimney and move over right. Pheewww! Relax and enjoy the remainder easy part of the climb to the bolted anchor.  *Alternatively one can double kneebar shuffle most of the wideness, but you still have to make the awkward moves to move into the chimney at the end.

The approach pitch. Easy climbing leads to a 5.7 move with no pro on entire pitch that we could find. 200+ feet. Make a belay at the start of the corner.  The crux. Move up into the corner and negotiate some awkward wide climbing. After this bit the climbing eases to super enjoyable hands to offwidth clean corner climbing for 200 feet. 70 meter rope stretcher pitch  Leave the corner and move left into a splitter hand and fist crack through a steeper section. Continue following the crack as it becomes lower angle. When the crack veers off left, move back right into the corner. Make a belay at a small stance/ledge. 70 meter rope stretcher pitch  Continue up the dome following the same crack system until you feel comfortable un-roping.   Continue up 2nd class slabs for a few hundred feet to the top of the dome. Move right into the gully and back down to the base.  No fixed gear or bolted anchors on route. I wouldn't be surprised if this line has been done before us as it's such an obvious and not too difficult line, however I found no mention of it any literature or did we find any evidence of previous ascents.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"The name 'It takes a Vilage' comes partly from all the different people that helped me put up this route. It took me 5 partners over 3 seasons of weekend trips to finish the route. The 'village' also includes those friends who aren't with us anymore. This route is dedicated to Zach Orman who died in a paragliding accident in 2013. He was an inspiring friend in my life and my thoughts were with him often while adventuring down in the canyon.  This is a beautiful 5 pitch line up an unnamed wall. \\xa0One of many such walls in the GCT. The route faces south and bakes in the sun so later season or an early start are key for the crux slab moves. The route is mostly crack climbing with some face climbing cruxes thrown in. Pitches 2 and 3 are beautiful and require a variety of crack techniques. Pitch 4 is the crux and is entirely face climbing with 4 bolts protecting the harder moves. The crux is on near vertical techy crimpy slab. After the bolts the climbing eases and follows beautiful golden edges with intermittent pro. This part is runout but never harder than 5.8. Pitch 5 features a mix of crack and face with one bolt. The route could continue to the right of the 5th pitch anchor along a weakness and then up a 30 ft slab to another massive ledge. Then there is another 300-400 ft dome above. Go get it!  The next party that goes up may want to bring some webbing and/or quicklinks and rap rings to add to the 1st and 2nd pitch anchor. Webbing up there is probably getting sun baked.  \",\n",

The route is exciting and physical and a must do for the High Sierra tick list.     Pitch 1: 3 options...Center option is a groove to a roof (slightly loose) (9+, 115\\').

What makes it difficult is that occasionally the feet disappear.      The feature appears to be an enormous horizontal dike that has split apart to form an incut crack.    P1: Ascend a 5.0 low angle crack system to a nice ledge at the start of the traverse.    P2: Climb off to the right at 5.4 with minimal gear to the beginning of the crack itself.  Stretch the rope out and belay at the best stance you can find.    P3:  Traverse right.  Save small cams for the crux.  Belay after turning the corner into a right-facing dihedral, or stretch the rope further to a better stance.    P4:  Continue traversing right and eventually end up on easy terrain leading to the descent.  Alternatively, climb the excellent Jailbreak Finish, or reverse the entire traverse for more fun.    Finding the route is somewhat difficult (moreso than most other climbs in the Meadows).  It's good to do this climb with someone who's been there before, or allow extra time to locate the start.\",\n",

Start 10 feet right of Little Sheeba where there is a ledge at chest height at the base of the wall. Clip 4 bolts on your way up and left following a left-facing feature that arches towards the crack. At the 4th bolt pull a tenuous boulder problem (crux of the route) to gain access to L.S. Go up L.S. for a few feet (0.75 cam with a long runner) and bust back right to a similar left-facing feature as below. Two more insecure mini-cruxes will get you past another 3 bolts to a broad ledge and an anchor with mussy hooks.  This route could be easily top roped. Scramble around to the right (4th class) to get to the walk-on ledge or lead L.S. and set up a TR on the right-hand anchor. The second clip is a bit reachy and a long draw or a runner will help with the ropedrag. I'd be curious to know what people think about the grade - 5.11+ was just a wild guess based on doing it in direct sun, so it could be much easier.\",\n",

While the bolts are well located to protect each hard move, you can expect to be well above each bolt on relatively easier climbing.  Start about 200 feet down and south (right) from the start of Direct NW Face, look for a low angle seam/crack on the face right near the edge of a recess on the right side of the apron.  Pitch 1: Head up the low angle crack as it heads up and right, as it bends further right find a nice 1-2\" cam placement and head up and left on the slab past two hard to see and well spaced bolts to a new double bolt anchor/rap. 5.7(5.6R) - 180 feet.  Pitch 2: Head up and right up ever steeper and harder face climbing with nice holds and good rests past 8 bolts to a double bolt anchor/rap. 5.9 - 180 feet.  From here you can do two double rope rappels from the fixed anchors or continue up Direct NW Face. If you choose to continue up, dirty slab up and right past an old rusty 1/4\" bolt on slabby ledges and then back left to join the second to last pitch of Direct NW Face - one move of 5.9R.',\n",

There is a second pitch with no pro that did not look that exciting.    P1: Climb mostly straight up, trending slightly left toward the first bolt.    One could clip the first bolt with a longer runner to completely eliminate drag, but it's not bad either way.    From the first bolt, climb on a diagonal mostly up and to the left for 6 more bolts.    At this point, there is a short section of slab Supertopo describes as 5.7, which this climber thought felt considerably easier, especially for the Meadows. You could take up some small gear, around green/yellow Alien sized, however if you haven't had trouble up to here, you most likely don't need it to get to the chains.    In general, whenever difficulty is encountered, the best course of action is to move further left, and then up. Positive holds abound.    Descent: Not sure on route length, but rapping on a single 60m rope will easily get you back to the belay ledge.\",\n",

Continue up the broken ledges and up a short crack that accepts wider pro.  Finish near the lip with a gear anchor wherever is convenient.

       "  'description': \"Excellent rock, and varied climbing make this a nice casual outing. Start off the right end of the ledge described under the rock section, in a left facing dihedral. This dihedral is obvious when looking at the crag from the road as the crescent shaped crack splitting the dome, sort of right-center with a smooth-ish face to it's left.    Pitch one (5.6) climbs the easy dihedral for about 70 feet, and then traverses straight right around the corner to a belay.     Pitch two (5.7) climbs a short steep crack, sort of up & left from the belay, and heads back to the main corner for a semi long pitch with good crack.    Pitch 3 (5.7) is a classic. It goes up the corner a few more feet, then traverses out onto the face towards a bolt. Clip the bolt, then go up huge vertical jugs on a golden face for about 100 feet. You basically have to run out this section. It is steep, but the jugs and knobs are gigantic. I tried slinging a chickenhead about halfway through the runout, but, it wasn't happening. No worries though, it is all positive. The pitch meets back up with the corner for a belay.    Pitch 4 (5.7) goes the rest of the way up the corner, and jogs out to the face for a couple moves. Top out on a really nice summit.    Walk off to the climbers left down an easy gully. Don't go too far left, you are looking for a narrow gully system. Reverse the walk off for Drug Dome once at the bottom of Mariuolumne Dome.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"Old-school route, expect run-out (to very run-out) sustained face climbing. Not a great route if you're trying to break in at the grade, but of you are comfy on run-out 5.10 face and crack climbing, this offers some of the best climbing in Tuolumne, hands down. A great example of a 5 star route that is just as quality as many classics, but doesn't get done that often.    Pitch 1: Climb the fist crack for about 40 feet, then up and left in to an unlikely looking crack that had some bushes in it. You can also climb the fist crack to the end, but that makes the crux before the pin harder (and has worse fall potential).     Pitch 2: This is where the first cruxy bit is. This pitch is tough to describe because it wanders around a bit.    Pull the bulge (2 options, both 5.10 and both with crappy fall potential), then clip a fixed pin and move up and right to a bolt (all bolts are new and shiny, thanks ASCA!). Make a long traverse right here--again, a crappy fall for both leader and second. Follow this to the Dike Crack, an awesome thin crack with pretty good feet where you need them. Bolted belay here. If you're a baller and don't place much pro, you can run these two pitches together.     Pitch 3: Another cruxy section, but both protected by bolts. After the second bolt (a tough traverse right) gets you to the tit flake. Pro is good here, but make sure you're placing it behind the thicker parts of the flake, not the thin parts, as pro would probably not hold. You can belay here at the top of the flaky bit (70 feet), or just keep going, which I recommend if you have a 70.     Pitch 4: Head up the obvious hand crack. At this point your mind is probably pretty blown at the quality of the climbing. Supertopo say don't keep going to the big cave as there is no pro, but this is not true, up and left part of the cave has a nice crack for 3 smallish cams or stoppers. Do not belay at the loose block on the right edge of the cave, it is hollow.    Pitch 5: 2 options, go up the dike for the 5.9 R/X version (felt pretty X to me...) or up and right for the 5.8 R version.        As said above, if you have a 70M rope, you can combine this into 3 pitches.\",\n",

If it weren't for all that, this would be a 4 star classic and one of the best pitches in Tuolumne. The variety of climbing, wild exposure up high, and sustained burliness make this a great and full-value climb worth hopping on if you're solid at the grade. And more traffic would clean it up a little and make it even better.  Climb the left-slanting jam crack which has everything from thin hands to offwidth. At a ledge in an alcove you can either belay or link it all together into one 11a+ megapitch. Stem and lieback out the steep alcove and into some chossy rock. Climb up the steep crack with face holds and into the final corner. The corner looks crazy steep from the ground but you're actually on your feet for this part. Knob climb and lieback to a bolted anchor. A little more easy 5th class leads above the anchor to the summit.  The crux is getting up to the bottom of the finishing dihedral. There's decent pro but it's a little stressful climbing because the rock is decomposed.\",\n",

From the large belay ledge atop p2 of Piss Easy, follow the 4\" wide golden dike that trends up and left on very polished and slick granite, surmounting a few small overlaps.  Fun thin slab moves all the way to the top, with a couple mantels.  End at a hole in the rock with two bolts equipped with rap anchors.    Descent:  I think you are supposed to rap down and left 50\\' to the Shagadelic anchors, then do two double rope raps to the ground.  We didn\\'t know this, and tried to go straight to the p1 shagadelic rap anchors directly below on the big ledge.

The first pitch is a bit notorious as well -- it tackles the massive roof just left of the Yawn.  But the upper pitches are excellent and not to be missed!    P1:  Climb the roof.  Crazy, unlikely stemming!  Belay at a bolted anchor.  5.11d, 90'.    P2:  Head up a steep crack in the corner.  Eventually the angle eases off as do the difficulties.  Stretch the rope out to an obvious ledge system that trends up and right into a ramp.  Belay at the highest point possible on this ramp.  5.10c, 180'.    P3:  There are three options:  Heading out left around the buttress above, or right (junky), or up through the middle -- this is supposedly the best, and is what we did.  Climb up easy ground over some stacked blocks to below the ominous roof above.  Place some gear in the solid rock above and jam and lieback your way up through the roof, finally to a welcome rest stance.  Strenuous!  Continue up the beautiful hand crack above (hopefully you've saved some gear), only stopping at a large, flat ledge near the end of the rope.  5.10d, 190'.    P4:  Continue up the remaining 15' of crack, situate some gear, then traverse right to a knobby face.  Follow this up into an easy corner system and again run the rope all the way out to 4th class near the summit.  5.8, 200'.

This pitch can be a bit dirty and wet. You are aiming for a shallow right-facing layback feature. Do not head up into the main corner/roofline! Belay just above the layback feature. (See beta photo below).  P2, 160\\', 5.9+- Get ready to sweat! Start the leaning crack by pulling over several chockstones/flakes. The jams are bomber, but the body position, awkward. Enter the maw! OW and squeeze your way through the flare. Strike a balance between the security of the back of the flare, and the slightly easier climbing towards the outside of the flare. I had success pushing a #4 C4 through much of the first half of the flare. Emerge, catch your breath, and climb easy liebacking on the right side of the flake. Belay under the roof, or continue to the bottom of the 5.7 \"hand\" crack to set up for pictures!  P3, 130\\', 5.7- Route-finding is a no-brainer. Follow the stunning \"hand\" crack in the back of the giant flare. Stem/chimney, or jam straight in. Your choice! Belay wherever, but if you are still hauling a pack, stop and belay somewhere to facilitate a clean haul.  P4, 175\\', 5.8ish- Keep following the right-facing feature. Pull around a bulge. The terrain eases from there. Stop atop a giant sandy ledge. There is a stout tree for a belay.  To top out, move left, and 4th class your way up some terraces, before cutting right along ledges to a saddle on top of the dome.

V3/V4 boulder problem, and all that that implies about the grade, gets you established above the bulge, clip another bolt. continuous 5.11- climbing gets you to a left facing flake that would take a .75 camalot, I believe. Follow the flake to the anchor. Relatively well protected, though pounding into the slab would not be pleasant.   Steep right off the belay and clip a bolt, no factor 2 falls. Look up, compose yourself and set off on through the slightly overhanging sea of knobs passing 3 bolts in 120\\' on the way to the next anchor. One of the BEST pitches ANYWHERE, if this was on East Cottage and had 6 bolts you would have to wait in line all day just to get on it.   Less steep that the previous 2 pitches with hard moves right off the belay and again the last 10\\' before getting to the horizontal. Traverse right about 30\\' to the next anchor, using stoppers and thin cams to protect the traverse.   Climb the flared, knobby, lichen covered (doesn\\'t pro real well) crack to its end and a 1/4\" bolt. If you have the luxury of an old, old Tuolumne guide book then you will see that it says to traverse right into a left facing corner, I instead headed straight up from the 1/4\" bolt on terrifying flaky way more runout slab climbing to the top.

       "  'description': \"By Hook or By Crook is an awesome, technical, and thought-provoking three-pitch climb up Harlequin Dome -- a candidate for one of the best 5.11's in Tuolumne.      P1: Begin at a shallow, right-leaning, right-facing dihedral at the center of the wall, near a large pine.  Recent rockfall has made this pitch more difficult and more dangerous -- a stick clip for the first bolt is highly recommended.  Ascend this corner via smears and powerful liebacks until a stance at the anchor below a roof. 5.11b.    P2: Start P2 by going right, clip an old bolt and then hand traverse to the right. The route then traverses left to an arete-like feature formed by a shallow right-facing corner.  Climb this after clipping an oddly-placed bolt (consider backcleaning or a long runner) up to a poor stance under a roof.  Hand-traverse back right a few feet and pull through the roof on extremely powerful liebacks.  Good, small gear here.  Continue up to another bolted belay.  5.11b, crux.  It is possible to descend from here with two raps on a single 60m rope, but the third pitch should not be missed.  Bring a second rope in this case or be prepared to walk off.    P3: Climb a long, tricky, right-facing corner to the top.  5.10c.\",\n",

(These ratings apply to 6' male...Switch the crux sections around if you are shorter and have small hands). At the top of the corner/roof, make a short, cool traverse left to an easy squeeze with lots of knobs and belay above off good nuts. (11a PG-13 and incredible fun)    P2. Up to the roof and traverse left on a hand rail to an ugly, knobby chimney. (5.7 R)\",\n",

The route has yet to be led ground up in true onsight style.

       "  'description': \"As the name implies, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. This route climbs much better than it may at first appear. In fact the climbing is excellent. You may choose to do this route in 4,5, or 6 pitches. Doing it in 4 requires a 70m rope or simul climbing 15' on the first and a bit on the last. The route starts out with enjoyable climbing, 5.6, following broken rock and cracks to a bolted station about 75' up. Belay here or continue up a left facing corner. Move out right at the end of the corner and follow discontinuous cracks and seams to an A shaped roof. Climb the right side of the A into a finger crack that ends at a comfy bolted belay. Get your stoppers ready, the next pitch likes to eat up small to medium size nuts, preferably offsets. Don't miss the sideways nut placement out on the face 35 or so feet up. I also find a spot for a pink tricam at mid height. The pitch finishes with friction climbing past 3 bolts to a 2 bolt belay/rap station. At this point the crux is 5.9 at most and takes great protection. But the next 2 pitches are much harder with a few  runout sections. The next pitch starts out with a short 5.11 section at the first bolt then gets much easier, though runout, passing three more bolts as you angle left to a 2 bolt anchor. The last pitch angles back right with several thin 5.10 moves, eventually ending at the last anchor on Stone Quest.\",\n",

       "  'description': \"This is an excellent climb up a large chunk of rock. It has several interesting pitches with a lot of variety. It is mostly well protected, but it's no sport climb, with a few sporty sections. Getting to the first bolt on pitch 5 is heads up with ankle breaker potential. The sixth pitch is stellar, one of the best pitches at P-Line. There are several variations one can do for pitch one, other than the original described here.     P1 (10c/d) Horizontal Cracks Pitch . Climb past several horizontal cracks then up thin face move to a ledge. Clip anchor, jog left then back right and up to a bolt leading to  a nice splitter finger crack to a bolted belay/rap station.    P2 (5.10 move) In Your Face Traverse Pitch. This short pitch is mostly a class 2 traverse to get to pitch 3. You will be surprised by what appears to be a short 4th class section. from P1 anchor traverse 100' right to a 2 bolt belay.    P3 (10a) The Shiny Path of Hope Pitch. From the belay, face climb to and up a vertical crack. Then follow the shiny path of hope(several bolts) up to another bolted belay/rap   station.    P4 (5.9) Scary Giant Flake Pitch. Climb up to the left side of a large pillar following it to a nice ledge w/a bolted belay/rap station.    P5 (10b) Black Bolt of Death Pitch. From the top of the pillar traverse left to a bolt(don't fall here). Continue left to another bolt. Climb up and right to a black bolt then up to a bolted belay/rap station below a large flake.    P6 (11a) Undercling Pitch. This pitch is stellar. Bust out several thin friction moves working left and up to the large flake. undercling out right to the end of the flake then follow a few well spaced bolts to a 2 bolt belay/rap station.    P7 (10a) Backwards SSS Pitch. From pitch 6 belay, move up and right passing a couple of bolts. Then right to another bolt. Continue right to a flake bulge. Pull through the bulge, then follow bolts back left to a 2 bolt belay/rap station. Watch the rope drag on this pitch.    P8 easy to the top    Can rap the route w/1 60m rope. At the top of p3 swing climbers left to an alternate rap station.   \",\n",

P2(5.8)-Alpine  Corners Pitch, follow the obvious left facing corners right of P1 anchor, up and right to a nice ledge and build a gear anchor. A#2 C4 is nice here    P3(5.7)- Straight up, follow the natural line of discontinuous cracks to a small ledge and another gear anchor.(Can link p3 & p4 w/60m rope)    P4(5.10)- Continue straight up the obvious line. Just past the belay keep an eye out for a natural thread that protects a move into the crack system (thin sling is needed for thread). Crux thin move at bulge where the crack peters out. Big move into nice finger crack. Move left to bolt when crack ends then climb past another bolt to a 2 bolt belay. There is a knob you can sling to protect the last moves to the anchor.    P5(10a)- Follow the ramp at your right up a bit and right into a left facing corner. Follow corner up until you can traverse left and move into the large left facing corner that hangs directly above the anchor. Follow this corner up to an awkward flaring chimney/stem move. Keep an eye out for the thin angling crack where you can protect with a Lowe Ball and a micro C3. Continue up another 15' to a bolt. Traverse left at the bolt (exposed) into a small left facing corner. Move up a bit and left into another small left facing corner. Finally, move left again to a 2 bolt anchor. WATCH ROPE DRAG AND PREVENT GETTING YOUR ROPE STUCK, IF YOU CAN, IN THE BEND IN THE CORNER.(A 2.5 Tri-cam is very nice on this pitch and the next right before the anchor).    P6(10+)- From the anchor, climb up to the bulge and clip a bolt (the 2.5 Tri-Cam protects the move getting to the bolt). Move a bit right and make a big move to a great, if you hit it right, incut hold. Mantle up and step back left into a left facing corner. Climb up and right over corner then up and back left into a discontinuous crack. Follow the crack to its end. Continue up the face past 2 bolts to a hummock ramp.

       "  'description': \"So far there are 4 pitches to this route but the plan is to cotinue up another pitch or two. The first 2 are fairly easy and can be linked with a 60m rope. Climb the jumbled buttress right of the giant corner, 30' rigth of Simon the Dog, same start as Wretched in Stone, to a flat ledge. There are now bolts here. From the ledge work up and left into a big Chimney(Wretched in Stone). Once in the chimney keep your eye out for a bolt up and rigth. Climb to then past the bolt then move rigth to another bolt and continue right to a big ledge with a bolted anchor. P3 the fun begins, traverses right into an obvious left facing corner. The corner starts out wide (optional #5 Camalot) then turns to a #3Camolot size crack for a ways then narrows to tight hands and fingers. Before the crack ends step out of the corner to the rigth and clip a bolt that protects 5.10ish climbing into dicontinuous cracks that lead to a sloping ledge (#2Camolot here)and a bolted anchor a bit farther left. P4 moves right to a thin finger crack that angles sharply right. Follow the crack(very fun) to its end. From it's end climb past a bolt, a pin and two more bolts. The crux is at the last bolt. After passing the bolt sling a small horn and search for a gear placement to protect your second(I was able to get an ok offset nut and a red C3), before traversing right to the, for now, last bolted anchor. 2 rope rap down and right a bit to Tweet this, then 1 rope to the base of Tweet and another down or 2 ropes down. Fun to tr Tweet This.\",\n",

Although it stays wet for a few days after a rain you can almost always avoid the water. It has a fun traverse and a nice exposed belay.

If you scramble to the right of Finger Lickin' you will see to large cracks/corners that face south. The right one is a chimney, and the left one is Pandora's Box.    Scramble down a brush filled gully (there is usually a fixed line here) until there is a short drop-off. You must find a place to belay here amongst the trees. The belayer will probably want an anchor. There is some easy hand-jamming to get up to the base of the fist crack. The crack starts out as #4 Camalots and narrows to 3's. Above is a slabby ledge that is capped by an overhang. The climb finishes out the left side of the overhang. There's some good pro here (small to fingers) and I had to stand in slings to get over the bulge (probably more like 5.10+ to free).    At the stance above I found a couple small hexes with some very tattered webbing. I added a large nut and got the whole rig equalized with some fresh cord and a locker, so the anchor should be bomber for a while but the soft materials will need to be replaced eventually. The guidebook also  shows the option of topping out and walking off, but who knows what kind of poison oak infested nightmare that would be.\",\n",

You can rap from here, or walk off to the right if you're planning on returning to the base of the wall for another climb. The upper pitches aren't very good and are only worth it if you're climbing back up to the road.    P3&4 - Either climb up the dirty crack above the ledge (5.7) or solo easy knobs off to the left (5.6 R/X). Soon the angle kicks back to 4th class. The belay options aren't great, either traverse over to trees in the gully to the right, or simul to the top. Watch out because the slab has a lot of loose sand and lichen on it.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Some great face climbing but on sometimes less than perfect rock (flakey) and some spicy sections imo. All anchors bolted  P1 - 11c (did something break?) - Head up the bolted line in the space between the \"inverted\" flake. Cool knob climbing with a move I couldn\\'t pull getting past the 3rd bolt. Unlike the rest of the route, you can pull through this crux. At the 4th bolt, go left into the chimney. Wild and hard. There\\'s another bolt in the chimney and then bust out of the flake/roof at the apex, really wild. Good and engaging climbing to the anchor. 11 bolts  P2 - 11b - This one actually felt true to the grade. Head up then straight right friction (crux) climbing past two bolts. Then head up into a shallow corner that is harder than it looks. Easy climbing up and left to the anchor. 8 bolts  P3 - 11a (yeah right) - 2 bolts gets you to a flake/thin crack and then up to an arete. Clip a bolt above the roof and then move left into a chimney. Up this for 15ft. til you can reach back right around the arete and clip another bolt. Hard moves lead around then up the arete. Getting to the next bolt is hard/far and the fall is kinda weird. Crazy and sustained arete moves to the anchor. I think the chimney is part of \"capital punishment\" and i\\'m sure you can take it to the top if you want  P4 - Easy to the top',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is a pretty unique route. The climbing and rock are pretty good in a few spots (and dirty in many others) but what really makes it worthwhile is the position. It climbs right along the lip of a really steep wall and, combined with the slab of the Cookie Sheet below, makes for a really exposed endeavor. There are some decent runouts on traversing terrain and routefinding issues to deal with.The cherry on top is the descent, unique in all the valley. Altogether, a great adventure  Here\\'s a thread with some more beta:   P1 - this is a total junker up through choss and dirt. Fire activity has mostly burned all the PO but has also made the soil very unstable. Anyway, aim up and right for a large, living pine tree. Pass this then head up and left through some mantles and bushes to the base of a nice handcrack  P2 - up the handcrack then step out on the slab to avoid bushes. pass an oak and belay near dead pine  P3 - locate the first bolt out right, climb past it, then keep going up and right passing one more bolt that protects a hard mantle move. I didn\\'t find any pins on this pitch. Belay at one bolt with a ring on it and small gear. There\\'s a 2 bolt anchor clearly seen out right that I think is the top anchor to \\'the higher truth\\' on the sugar cookie, but you don\\'t climb to it.  It sounds like many have bailed from this point, P4 looking a bit too gnarly. I think you could rap straight down and hit the anchor for 60/40 on the sugar cookie with one rope, but not 100% on that one. There is an easier variation to P4 that goes straight up. There is a bolt maybe 15 ft. up and bit left from the anchor. \"Afraid of the Edge\"  P4 - big exposure! the crux moves come pretty close to the belay so it may be better to have stronger partner follow. blowing it while following would result in a ride over the edge. there was nothing \"blind\" about the moves, imo, just a hard foot match. anyway, clip a bolt 15 ft. right of the belay, head up a corner, then traverse right to another bolt. easier and runout climbing leads up and right past one more bolt. I belayed on a clean slab with a horizontal crack for gear. They call this 5.8+... whatever... 5.9  P5 - head up the corner to get established on the upper slab, traverse straight right to a bolt and climb the arete on jugs. some more awesome exposure here. belay at some small, living pines.  P6 - this is kind of an unnerving pitch. head straight right, and even slightly down, to get established on the featured wall. follow the path of least resistance, mostly straight right. eventually, and hopefully, you will find a bolt. it\\'s kind of hidden but just keep looking. Then head up to some black rock and perform some awesome and big moves on good rock, protected by good gear in a horizontal. You may wish to stop and belay at the big pine above. Otherwise, keep heading right on the dirty ledge to a big flake  P7 - climb the big flake/crack that leads to the top.',\n",

Hike up the road to the mouth of this tunnel, jump over the stone wall, and follow a steep track down the cliff for 3 minutes.  This deposits you at the top of the Separate Reality visor.  Just before walking onto the slab, locate a good pine tree to fix a line to and do a short (40') rap down to a staging area at the base of the climb.

You could maybe boulder it if you want, with some pads protecting the rock below, but you probably won't since you might fall on your head.    Start with finger locks and liebacking in the corner. Undercling out the roof and sink a great handjam at the lip, then a fist jam, and then you flip upside down and throw your foot in above you. Use hand-stacks to scoot your foot jam up.

An 80m rope might make it to the top of the cliff. I think with a 70m you will have to simulclimb 20ft or stop and belay at a hand crack just shy of the top.    Start a ways to the right off a boulder that touches the base of the wall. Climb up to a high first bolt, and then continue upwards to a second bolt. The bolts were recently replaced and are bomber. From the second bolt downclimb a short ways and traverse perhaps 15 feet to the left. From here continue up on smaller knobs to reach a small footledge below a water-streak. Down at the bottom of the footledge is a knob that you can tie off which protects the next crux. (It\\x92s also possible to escape here by traversing further left on big knobs to a bolted rap anchor) Make one sort of thin move above the ledge to gain a good rail and bigger knobs in the water-streak. There is another \\x91ok\\x92 knob that can be tied off here, before you must mantel onto a hummock which is growing out of the bottom of a flake. This leads to directly below the roof where there is good gear (1\\x94-1.5\\x94 cams). Getting over the roof is easy thanks to big knobs and then it\\x92s a cruise to the top of the cliff.',\n",

       "  'description': 'A short, but powerful route. Start on either side of the triangular flake (left side is easy but sparse pro) up to a finger crack. Work left and crank through a small roof (crux). Continue up splitter hand crack (have those gold camalots ready!), make a fun move right, and continue up to the top. Belay from tree.    Walk off left.    If not up for leading, it would be easy to rig a top-rope off a tree by scrambling up and left from the base of the route.    There is also a fun 10b variation that can be led or top-roped. From the base, climb the left side of the triangular flake, traversing left and then back right around a flake resembling the state of Texas. After working back to the right, join up with the main route. If top-roping, a directional is recommended to prevent a big swing from the left end of the \"Texas flake\".',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is what it\\'s all about, pitch after pitch of demanding, ultra high quality climbing on excellent stone w/ a surpassing view.  Almost all the pitches would be highly sought after if they were base routes and three or four would be mega classics.  If you don\\'t think this climb is great, either you\\'re just being contrary or you need to find another sport.    Bibliographic Note 1: SuperTopo.com has an excellent free topo download for this climb that most will find more useful than the following route description:       Bibliographic Note 2: An old issue Rock and Ice (from the 80s) had an article by Bob Yoho providing the pitch by pitch \"betamax\" - move by move sequences for all the cruxes -- on this route.  This is amusing to look at after you do the climb, but it will probably just confuse you beforehand.    Approach: Walk east from the Awahnee on a road for about 15 minutes until you encounter a climber\\'s trail on the left which heads up to Column.  The climber\\'s trail can be hard to spot in low light, so if you\\'re getting an early start, it\\'s worth scoping out at least this much of the approach beforehand.  The climber\\'s trail continues past the start of AM which is more or less directly below the obvious right-facing enduro corner. After leaving the main climber\\'s trail, scramble up ledges to a small ledge with a tree which is where the climb starts.  Without routefinding errors, the approach can be done in an easy 45 minutes.    P1: Trend up and right on easy vegetated ground for about 100\\' to a ledge with anchors.  This bushy pitch can be wet and unpleasant in spring.  It makes sense to skip this belay and continue up a right facing layback w/ finger jams (short stretch of 10a) on steeper, nicer rock for about another 50 feet to another set of anchors; if you plan on doing the easier version of the next pitch, belay here, otherwise traverse left 20\\' and belay at the base of a thin crack.  10a 170-190\\'    P2: The Boulder Problem.   Option 1 the traditional Boulder Problem:  From the left end of the ledge, climb up a thin crack, fiddle in some small nuts, bust some fingery, feetless, old school 11c moves (the technical crux of the route), reach a ledge/flake and traverse right 20, then up another 20\\'of ~5.9 layback jamming to a small, sloping ledge w/ fixed anchors.   Option 2, easier, more direct, less well protected.  This variation goes straight up, avoiding the two traverses.  Historically, the route did not go this way because it was harder to protect but with modern small cams (~blue Alien) it is safe.   The climbing is thin laybacking/face climbing.  ST rates it 10a but 10d is more like it.  The need to hang out and place gear adds some difficulty.  After you make it through the crux first 10\\', you encounter a ramp with a crack in it.  Be forewarned, this may be covered in dirt, exasperating when you are desperately trying to plug a unit (~ red Alien).  Above this point, the two options merge.    I will blasphemously recommend option two, skipping the boulder problem, as the more direct, in character with the rest of the climbing, momentum preserving way.  Note: Dean Potter caught some grief when he took the piker\\'s variant during his solo of AM, so if you\\'ve got hardass friends or are in the limelight, you might want to \"bear down\" and go the hard way.    Note 2: Either way, this is a quality pitch.    Pitch 3: The Enduro Corner.  Totally classic, an endless Indian Creek style, continuous corner which favors those with smaller hands.  Starts out with 2.5 Friends and gradually thins.  Keep you eye out for the occasional bomber handjam and stem rest.  Towards the top, the corner thins more (1.5 Friend) and most people go from jamming laybacks to straight laybacking.  This point is probably the crux of the pitch and ends with a thank god sinker hand jam.  The last 40\\' of the pitch are 5.7 chimney in which it is nice to have a 4 Friend or Camalot.  Belay at the second set of anchors, on a big ledge.  11c 165\\'.   If you rap from here, you\\'ve done Astroboy.    P4.  One of two \"easy\" pitches on the climb.  Head up and left in an easy, blocky corner system for maybe 20\\'until you hit an cruiser handcrack which is followed to a small stance in a flare with bolted anchors.  5.9 80\\'.    P5.  Another great one, reminiscent of the Rostrum.  Follow a wide hands corner crack for about 1/2 a rope length until encountering a roof;  the trick on this pitch in rationing and/or walking your bigger gear through this section.  From the roof, reach left to a thin crack system, finagle in some small gear (RPs, purple Alien) then step over to this crack and follow it up ( 10c layback & face climbing, occasional small nut) until you can reach back right where the crack is easier and followed to another bolted anchor ledge beneath the ominous, impending maw of The Slot.  10c, 130\\'.       P6. The Harding Slot.  Competitor of the Hollow Flake for THE imagination seizing Valley pitch.  Many strong climbers have melted down here.  There are a couple of reasons for this: first, it requires a style of climbing that is rarely encountered outside of the Valley and avoided in general and second, most average and large size people don\\'t believe they can fit through the slot.  (This is a great pitch to be small on.)     At any rate, from the belay crank up on straight forward 10+/11- laybacking for about 25\\' until a stance.  Place some #1 Friend size gear (BETA ALERT: there is an obvious 1.5 Friend placement here -- don\\'t fill it up w/ gear.)  Once you\\'ve got bomber gear, make a plan and execute.  The next 6 or 7 feet can be both baffling and exhausting.  You\\'re working with very thin hands (for only one hand!) in a slick, smooth flare that\\'s not quite a chimney and not quite a corner.  ST indicates a \"dyno chicken wing\" is the secret here;  I say nonsense -- that\\'s the sort of inscrutable beta that\\'s likely to leave have you hanging on the rope, thinking about rap anchors.   So somehow you\\'ve passed the entry move, and you\\'re standing on a small ledge, still able to move your head.  You\\'re officially in the slot.  Make sure there\\'s nothing on the back of your harness (you should have lengthened your knot at the belay and left your helmet on the ground) and start squirming.  They say take an \\'S\\' path but it\\'s not like you could move otherwise.  Stay calm and settle for an inch at a time progress.  The entire slot itself is about 20-25\\' long and the really narrow part 10-15\\'.  There is gear to be had in the back of the slot but don\\'t place it unless you have it in for your second; anyhow, it would be pretty hard to fall -- if you slipped, you\\'d quickly wedge.   For those absolutely too large to squeeze through, there is an alternative, laybacking the outside of slot, supposedly 11 X.  (I question the X as I\\'ve heard a fairly reliable story of a guy going this way and taking the fall unscathed three times before he finally made it through.)  I\\'ve belayed a 2nd taking this outside route and it seemed horrendous -- if possible, any members of your party who have to go this way should be following.    The Slot is the key to route.  Be ready for it which means having someone who can lead 5.10 squeeze and get through the baffling entry moves.  Some parties which had been cruising up to that point bail after being stymied by the entry moves.  There are some great pitches above the slot and just because one move is giving you fits is no reason not to experience them; if need be, aid a couple moves and press on.   11b, 60\\'.    Note: you probably started the slot in the sun and ended in the shade.  Plan accordingly.    You\\'re now at the point of no return.  The ledge at the end of slot is the last with bolted anchors and the last place you could reasonably retreat from.    P7.  Hands around a roof (10b), then some 5.9ish hands brings you to a spot where the traditional route goes left at 11b and the pikers var. right at 10c.  The 11b way is better (technical face/stem move with good gear) but if your tank is running low, discretion might be the better part of valor.  More quality 5.9 cracking takes you to a good ledge where you\\'ll actually have to rig your own belay.  11b/10c 150\\'.    P8.  Changing corners.  Fantastic.  20 or 30\\' of easy ground bring you to mantle (11a) which is one of those moves that you can sail through one time only to flail the next time.  There is an old, questionable bolt here which can be backed up w/ something like a yellow Alien; if you\\'re really motivated top rope pro (#2 Rock?) can be had.  After the mantle, some more easy ground takes you to the base of the corner, right-facing at this point, which is ascended until things get too hard and you step left around the arete onto slabby face which is followed for a few feet until you start wondering about your last pro, out of sight, below you around the arete.  BETA ALERT: reach blindly back right and place something (2 Friend, 1 Camalot?) in the original corner.  Eventually you rejoin the corner, now facing left, for a long stretch of fingerlocks and stemming (small nuts).  (The face passage is sensational but can be avoided by staying in the corner (11d, better gear)).  After the corner ends, continue in easier, wider cracks (good to have a 3 Camalot and a 4 Friend) until a stance in the vicinity of a couple of fixed pins.  There are several belay options before this point but its good to stretch it to here in order to be able to link the next two pitches. 11b 150\\'.     P9:  Blast through a long stretch of 10- which trends right.  Then up 50\\' of 5.9 cups and fists (#3 through #4 Camalot, easy to walk).  At the end of this crack, step right and hand traverse right to the left end of a long ledge and set up a belay.  This may be a really good pitch, but at this point you\\'re probably too sated to really appreciate it.  10a, 200\\'.    Move the belay to the right end of the ledge.    P10.  The scary face pitch.  Not the best pitch on the route, but as the sting in the tail, essential to the experience.  The nature of the rock changes from classic Valley granite to something less desirable.  Up an easy corner for about 20\\'.  Then a reachy 10+ move with decent protection including an extruding angle that makes a good foothold (shame); ST gives this section an R but it seemed pretty well protected to me.  Up a few easier face moves, taking whatever gear you can get, and establish yourself at the base of a thin, downward pointing flake.  You can get ostensibly decent gear at the bottom of the flake (red RP, blue Alien) but the flake is expanding, so this gear probably isn\\'t worth much.  If you\\'re lucky, there may be some fixed heads within reach to the left.  Whatever the case, sack up, commit to sending and work up the flake (10b) which gradually gets easier but doesn\\'t offer pro for at least 20\\'; if you blew it in this section, it is possible you\\'d zipper all the way down  to a menacing spike at the start of the difficulties.  At any rate, you succeed, place a 1.5 Friend size piece (phew!) and romp up easier ground to a ledgey area.  10d, 100+\\'.    50\\' of 4th class up and right leads to the top of the column.    Descent: follow a rough trail, north for a short while and then east for much longer, with the occasional class three or four section.  This will eventually feed you into slabs which are tediously descended (class two to four, possibly complicated by wet streaks) until you eventually can walk back west towards the column and find the trail to your packs and the bottom.  The full descent from the top of the column to the valley floor will take two to three hours and would be quite sketchy in the dark.  I don\\'t remember much more about the descent but it would probably be well advised to consult SuperTopo or some other authoritative reference before embarking on it for the first time.',\n",

       "  'name': 'Direct Route',\n",
       "  'description': 'The Direct Route on Washington Column is an old classic climb that used to extremely popular until it became forgotten as more (better) climbs became discovered. The first half climbs the original route to Lunch Ledge which was the first technical climbing route done in the Valley by legends Harvey Voge, Richard Leonard, Jules Eichorn and Bestor Robinson in 1933. The Direct Route continues up from Lunch Ledge to the summit via chimneys.     It doesn\\'t ring true anymore but Roper summed it up in the old 1971 Green Valley Guide by saying, \"Although not terribly enjoyable or aesthetic, this route is probably done by most climbers who stay in the Valley for any length of time.\" Not as clean or classic as the Royal Arches, the Direct Route is a step up in difficulty but is fun enough with cool history that it deserves to be done at least once in every Yosemite climber\\'s tenure. If nothing else it\\'s a great moderate adventure climb to pass a day in the shade for most of the route if starting early.       Approach up to the base of the Column and follow it left towards the huge gully separating the Column from the Arches wall. After passing the gully on the right, take 3rd classes ledges up and right to the base of the first pitch.     NOTE: This description assumes you are climbing with a 70m rope and dont mind a few short simul climbing sections off the anchors. Otherwise it\\'s very easy to belay almost anywhere if using a 60m.     There are many fixed pins on this route, which doesn\\'t always mean you are ON route, but generally, if you see them, you\\'re going the right way.     P.1 (5.7) Off the belay, down climb about 25 ft. until able to start moving up the obvious corner right, past a bush, to a small ledge with an old tat anchor. From the anchor, cross around right into 5.7 face on gritty rock passing a tree to the left and up the corner past another old bolt anchor. Make sure to resist cutting too far right. Continue straight up and eventually trend right up small ledges passing a final third bolt anchor to belay on a ledge at a huge pine tree. 230 ft.    P.2 (5.9) At the tree is the base of a short 5.9 corner. Climb up about 30 ft until able to cut out left on the face to get into an easier corner, following many fixed pins, up and right until you reach a nice ledge with a big pine tree and a distinct tree with three trunks. 220 ft.     P.3 (5.8) From the ledge, climb up a small boulder and continue straight up easy climbing past more trees and pins until reaching a small ledge with a fixed pin on the wall. A short 5.7 \"mantel\" move left with a high step onto the next ledge and then traverse past an old bolted anchor to the base of the Reigelhuth \"Chimney\" with a bolt about 10ft. up. More of a hand crack than chimney, one wide move leads to easier climbing up to Lunch Ledge. As one of the most famous ledges in the Valley, it\\'s quite underwhelming. 240 ft. with some simul climbing off the anchor. If using a 60m belay at the bolt anchor below the Reigelhuth Chimney.     P.4 (5.8) From Lunch Ledge you choose to either climb the \"Fat Man Chimney\" or the \"Charlie Brown Chimney\". Fat Man is easier with better protection and fixed pins while Charlie Brown is harder and more run out. Charlie Brown will lure you from Lunch Ledge with a deceptively easy and cleaner beginning to the right but don\\'t be tempted! (Unless you\\'re psyched) For Fat Man, continue straight up passing a small tree to the left and up crumbly 5.7 face along the corner that turns into the Fat Man Chimney. Pass two old bolts and pins until continuing up a hand crack after the chimney up and right, passing a tree, to the anchor. 215 ft.    P.5 (5.9) From the anchor climb up and right around the arete over a small step to easy 5.6 face reaching a short 5.9 insecure corner section. At the top walk up sandy ledges for 100 ft. until reaching a ledge with a huge tree at the base of the Great Chimney. 200 ft. Also possible to continue 25 ft higher to the actual base of the chimney and link both chimney pitches into one with a 70m rope.     P.6 (5.8) Start off with old school 5.8 wide chimney moves past a piton. Climb over 3 large chock stones until reaching the usual midway belay ledge with bushes. If using a 60m stop here and belay. Otherwise, continue up past pins to another large chock stone and up until reaching a ledge with a huge pine tree. 250 ft from lower tree belay, 220 ft. from base of chimney.     P.7 (5.7) Climb up an easy chimney section to another small ledge. Instead of continuing straight up to harder climbing cut left behing the big corner to easier climbing. Continue up until eventually tunneling under a huge car sized boulder and up to the belay ledges. 200 ft.     P.8 (5.10a or 5.9 var.) From here there are a lot of options and it is confusing to find anything familiar. Stay left and up for easy scrambling exit pitches or move the belay up and over right for about 200 ft. until at the base of a corner with a large white flake on the ground. From the flake, climb up a glory 2\" hand crack to a small roof. At the roof cut right on a 5.7 hand traverse to either continue right and up on the variation (slightly easier) or back up and left of the roof to a midway belay ledge with a tree. If using a 60m belay here. Continue up the 5.9 corner with quickly degrading rock to one last 5.10a move from under the roof and up onto the summit slab.     From the summit continue up sandy slopes to the summit of the Column and take the North Dome Descent Gully down.',\n",

       "  'description': \"Crest Jewel is a fantastic high-elevation slab climb; perhaps the best in the country.  Certainly the best I've done in Colorado or California.  If you only ever do one long slab climb, this should be it.      The climb is fairly well-bolted (entirely with modern hardware and safe belays), but expect typical run outs on the easier terrain (5.8 and below).  These generally feel less and less scary  later in the route as you become accustomed to the style.  The crux, if doing Crest Jewel Direct, comes early and is very well protected.      I'm not going to give a pitch-by-pitch description of the climb, but it would behoove parties who haven't done the climb before to have a photocopy of the topo with them -- if only to figure out which general direction to head off in when departing a belay -- often the next protection bolt is hard to spot and the climbing could conceivably go anywhere.    The original Crest Jewel accesses the wall from the left side at about one-third height, whereas Direct begins at a high-point at the base of the dome, also towards the left margin of the main face.  Direct intersects that first pitch of the original route after five pitches of harder slab climbing.  Most parties approach via Royal Arches which makes for a  very full 30-pitch day.    The route gets sun all day long and can really cook up there, but the wind can also pick up making things quite unpleasant.  Views of the Valley and Half Dome in particular are outstanding.\",\n",

       "  'description': 'This route is surprisingly good.  Reid\\x92s book only gives it one star, but most people who have climbed it consider a hidden gem.  You\\x92ll encounter solid rock decorated with slabs, face, cracks, corners, chimneys, no fixed gear, exposure and amazing views of Half Dome the entire way.  Although rated 5.7 there are some thought proving sections.  Personally, I felt that the 5.7 rating was a sandbag and you could easily argue that some sections are closer to 5.9.  Climb it for yourself and decide.  Linking this with Royal Arches will give you 23 pitches of trad climbing in one day.  It is hard to beat that.    P1: Up the slabs (5.6R) to a crack.  Take the crack to tree with slings.  160\\x92    P2: Go up and right into the corner (5.5) and belay about 50\\x92 below slings that are hanging high up in the corner.  These slings are off route. 100\\x92    P3: Probably the crux of the route (5.7 sandbag).  Again, do not go to the slings in the corner as they are not part of this route.  Continue up the corner a little ways until you see a ledge that goes right and around the dihedral.  There is a large hole with an undercling in it.  The problem to figure out is how to get your foot in the hole while using the undercling that will be at your feet.  There is pro before the move that you need to add a sling to in order to avoid rope drag.  Consequently, if you fall you will likely hit the slabs below.  All the moves are there once you commit to it.  Continue traversing the face (stopping to admire Half Dome) until you reach a shallow crack.  Head up the crack to a bush and set up a belay.  160\\x92    P4: Up the crack (5.7) with a little bit of face climbing (5.6) near the top.  Belay below the chimney at a ledge. 165\\x92    P5: Maybe the best pitch on the route.  Up the chimney (5.7) with right side in so that you can use holds on the outside of the chimney to help you advance. When the chimney pinches down head out and then up an amazing perfect low angle splitter hand crack (5.6) in a right facing dihedral.  At the top you will encounter some bushes.  Break left and set up a belay, again at the bottom of the dihedral. 160\\x92    P6. A little bit of chimney then up and right into the corner with the splitter 1\\x94 crack (5.7).  Layback this low angle crack until you\\x92re almost out of rope and set up a hanging belay. 190\\x92. You could also stop lower at a better belay stance.  However this will likely add another pitch to the climb.    P7. Continue up a bit more of the layback. Two options now exist.  Option A (5.9R): Go up the crack until it ends, place a few piece of pro (small cam and med nut) then run it out up progressively easier slab climbing.  The harder moves are with in 10\\x92 of the pro.  Option B (5.7): go right along a small roof until it ends then go up.  I did not do this option, but it probably the original line.  Either way head up the summit slabs as far as you can until you find a suitable belay. 100\\x92    North Dome Gully Descent:  Walk north along the top of the dome looking for a trail that eventually heads west.  Follow this trail down hill heading slightly away from the dome.  If you lose the trail (which I found likely) you will have serious bush whacking good times.  Eventually break east crossing the slabs that were seen during the approach.  Continue down the slabs until you reach the trail on top of Royal Arches.  Follow this trail east going up and over Washington\\x92s Column.  At one point you will have an easy class 2 descent on a sandy 2 foot ledge with a significant drop to the right.  Soon after, the trail seems to dead end.  If you\\x92ve reached this point, back track a little.  Go up hill a bit and cross a steep slope.  Continue east for another half mile to a mile.  Looking to the right you will eventually see the decent through the sandy boulder field.  Follow this down to the valley floor.  One of the major problems I found with this decent are the numerous trails that begin and end.  From the top of North Dome to the Valley floor is likely 4 hours for someone who has not done the decent before.  Here are a few tips to help you through this.  First, keep in mind that there are no rappels necessary, so if you are thinking about setting one up just keep on going. Secondly, if you go to the east side of Glacier Point Apron (near Grack) and look across you should see the decent.  This will help you understand how far from Washington\\x92s Column the gully is.  Lastly, doing this in the dark in for the first time could have some serious negative side effects.  I saw several bivy sites on top of Washington\\x92s Column that are likely from climbers who have decided to wait until morning before heading down.  If in doubt, pack a space blanket,lighter to start a fire and hunker down.   ',\n",

Up to this point Reid topo was fine. But P6 left me in doubt what we did. From belay directly above was dirty mossy corner with no pro which possible was the route Donini climbed  40 years ago. At the same time clean wide crack leaning 45 degree toward right from belay  and looks well protectable , but very hard. And it was no way 5.10. Than it goes vertical  hard double crack with some hand jams. We call it second crux 5.11. 80ft.   Edit: my theory that some big blocks of rock fell near the top of p5/ beginning of p6, since 1972  FFA.  This made transition to 5.9/5.10 chimney impossible leaving only the choice of 5.11 wide crack leaning  toward right from the top of p5.     P7. You have the choice to climb left chimney or right chimney. Topo did not help to make the choice. We climbed right chimney and still not sure did we make correct choice or not. 160 ft, 5.8.   [Edit] After reading Christina TR where they ended up at the same dead end as we did- I think Left Chimney should be taken which make an easier way to the top of Dome.    Climbing eased up   couple more pitches to reach the top of Basket Dome following crack system.  We reached dead end on our way, down climb, transitioned left to other crack system and finally reached the top of the Dome    The route has no bolts, no pitons, no slings- nothing can imply that anyone climbed it before you. At the same time most of the pitches have superb quality, but with some dust and  dirt falling in your face if you looking up watching your partner. Except some funny sound plates on p3, no loose rock on the route.',\n",

Follow the discontinuous crack and arete and then finish on some sinker finger jams.    This used to be super dirty, but I took a wire brush to it, replaced the anchor bolts, and trundled a 3ft block from the ledge at the top, so the climb is good-to-go now.

It is also entirely bolted (even the TCU crack at the top!) -- a very enjoyable change of pace from things like the Steck-Salathe.

Note that the Reid Guide is seriously misleading in terms of the location of this route:  The topo on pp. 246 & 247 shows routes 'A' through 'R'.  The Great Escape, route 'U', actually is located between routes 'I' and 'J' on this topo.      The start of this route is somewhat hidden by boulders and trees.  Begin in a right facing corner at a high-point along the base of the cliff.    P1:  Climb easily up cracks to the top of a pillar (a #2 Camalot will protect this, but the climbing is easy).  Clip an anchor, and then perform a difficult 5.11a traverse right.  Climb up past bolts to a ledge with a small tree (visable from the base).  Belay.  5.11a.    P2:  The crux.  Head up the thin, sustained face above.  5.11c.  Traverse right to a belay in a right facing corner/ramp.    P3:  Head up the ramp past bolts, then up a crack to a roof.  Pull the roof to the right, and continue up to a belay.  5.11b.    P4.  Pumpy, but easier than pitch two.  Climb up the overhanging crack system past bolts.

Above the roof is a pretty good rest, followed by devious climbing on a series of sidepull flakes. The route almost joins Mr. Pinkeyes, then splits off to the right on a series of edges to the anchor.    Continuously challenging. With perfect beta the roof is probably the crux because it gets a bit pumpy there, but there are a bunch of moves on the route that can feel really hard if you don't use the right sequence.

       "  'description': \"This is the prominent gully which runs from Happy Isles to the notch at the north end of Grizzly Peak. It can be used to approach/descend routes on Grizzly Peak, and it is also the most direct approach to the southwest shoulder of Half Dome (although it's only the fastest approach to Snake Dike, et al, if you know what you're doing and are a fast bushwhacker)    The start of the gully is basically straight above Happy Isles. If you're walking on the path along the road, you'll cross the river and then the JMT/Mist trail leaves the road and heads off to the right (south). From the bridge, follow the trail for 200ft or so and then turn left and head straight uphill (east) through the forest.    Hopefully you'll start following a faint drainage and then end up at the bottom of a 35ft water-polished gully which looks like this:       This is the only section of 4th class on the route, and it's pretty easy (especially going up). Most of the rest of the way involves zig zagging on ledges. There's a steep narrow 5th class gully off to the left which is off-route. Nothing should be exposed and some of the key bits of 3rd class scrambling should look somewhat well-traveled. The bushwhacking should also be pretty minimal. In the upper 3rd, the route begins to actually resemble a gully again with some 3rd class slabs and steep dirt/grass. Then the gully splits. I think either way goes, but I've only been down the south fork (that's climber's right).    From the notch it's 3rd class to the summit of Grizzly Peak. Avoid some steep sections by staying on the left (south side) of the ridge.    If descending the gully just read the description in reverse. In general I found it worked pretty well to stay to the right (out away from the trees/bushes) until I'd get cliffed-out, then cut back left to find an easy way down to the next tier.\",\n",

Walk the JMT/Mist trail for a few minutes and you will pass a large trailhead sign with the mileage for many different destinations. Walk just a little bit further and you will see an interpretive sign about \"Rock Piles\". Scramble up the talus just to the left of the sign until you find the old Sierra Point trail. It\\'s still a fairly popular hike and the path should be well-worn and easy to follow.    From Sierra Point ascend the brushy ledges along the ridge. After a couple minutes you will need to make a short downclimb to the right, then climb back out to the right on a thin crack in a corner. More ledges lead to the first \"step\" on the ridge.    Next you will encounter a prominent rib of 5th class rock. Ledges lead around to the right side of this, but they cliff out under some overhangs. Instead traverse on the left side of the ridge where the rock is slabbier. Eventually you will head up a corner/gully back onto the ridge proper. Then make an exposed step left into a chimney and tunnel through and up to more ledges.    That\\'s it for the 4th class and exposure. The rest of the way to the summit is an unenjoyable bushwhack. Sign the summit register.    The easiest descent is to downclimb the notch route (class 3). Hike down the east ridge towards the notch. Stay to the right (south) side of the ridge whenever necessary. A couple short and unexposed downclimbs are all that\\'s needed to reach the notch. From there you can descend the LeConte Gully back to the Valley floor, or bushwhack onwards to Half Dome, Broderick, ect...',\n",

       "  'description': \"Mahtah is an amazing route that should be considered on par with some of the better long sustained 5.12 crack climbs in the country. It has very little wide climbing, and lots of pumpy endurance climbing and traversing, with no singular bouldery problem or sequence harder than V4/V5. The rock quality is excellent.  The climb follows several long right-facing corners, with a few memorable roof encounters, some splitters, and a 45m traverse pitch to connect major crack systems into a free route. The setting above Nevada Falls and perched above the main Yosemite Valley is scenic, and the walkoff descent is casual.The overall difficulty is needing the fitness for completing similarly demanding endurance pitches stacked together, along with the technique for some slabbier bits. Most people will find P5 (sustained 5.12, pumpy gear and maybe a bit grassy) or P6 (shorter with straightforward burl) to be the crux pitch. The FFA team left the grade a bit open ended in the AAJ, suggesting 80s 5.12b to 5.13- for the overall.  This route combines sections of the aid routes SW Face, Direct SW Face, and Bad Moon Rising, but doesn't rely on much fixed aid gear. The attached topo is all you really need, go have fun!\",\n",

       "  'description': 'Scarface now goes both free and clean. This route starts with a few hundred feet of dirty cracks before entering the clean white granite of the rock scar. The difficulty of this routes lies in the two 5.12 crux pitches, P5 and P8. The rest of the route is in the 5.10 to 5.11- range and climbs quite quickly.    If the first few pitches clean up more this has the potential to be a great route. As it stands expect a little bit of foliage at the start and on the last pitch.  All belays up to P9 have bolts or are at trees with rappel slings. This would still be a very fun outing at 5.11a C2 and could be done in a day.      From the ground climb up a series of dirty ledges and step left to short corner. Stem and layback up until you can move left to the base of a thin crack. Climb the thin crack, passing a bolt and get established in a slabby corner. A few hard moves getting to, and working past another bolt lead to an exciting stemming sequence and a belay at a tree on the left.    This pitch is often dirty and can be wet in the early spring. Having a nut tool to clean out the crack is a plus. The stances are pretty good, so you cleaning on the go doesn\\'t add much difficulty.      From the belay work up to the right and start climbing the long and  varied corner. A crux comes pretty early getting past a bulge. Midway up the pitch you will mantel up onto a dirty ledge with a pink rope setup as a rap station, keep climbing!    The endless layback resumes with nice finger slots and a few bushes.  Make a few hard moves to get through a short chimney section and a nice rest out right. Romp up the final crack, with some more fun laybacking! Belay at a good stance at the tree with a green rappel sling.      This is the cleanest of the first three pitches. Start off with a few tricky layback moves or stem up using the large dead tree as a foot hold. Crisp finger locks lead you out right to yet another section of slopey layback (hopefully you\\'ve got it dialed by now). Punch it until the edge of the crack gets better and figure out how to get yourself standing on the chalkstone. A couple more tricky moves get you to a grove of trees. Sling something for pro and do some easy (5.7/5.8) but unprotected face climbing on the wall to the right of the trees to get established on a big, and often sunny, ledge. Belay at two bolts.      The climbing is never particularly run out, but there are occasional places where there is loose rock and one spot with bad fall potential, thus the R rating. The climbing on the \"R\" section is not much harder than 5.8/5.9, just be careful with rock quality.    Start just to the right of the bolted belay with thin gear and a few mantels. Some tricky stemming gets you established on a wide ledge. Go right and up through some chossy rock to get established in an awesome left leaning hand crack. When the crack ends step to the right avoiding the ledge covered in loose rock. Some thin gear protects tricky moves to get into a chossy hand crack. Fun crack and face moves over a series of blocks lead to a two bolt belay on a nice 3\\' x 5\\' ledge.         The first of many stellar pitches. From the belay you can either face climb straight up past two bolts or use the wide crack out left. In both cases be careful to avoid the precarious stacked blocks above the wide crack. Traverse across the grainy rail until you reach a no-hands stance.  Face climb/layback up a semi-expando flake with good gear out left. Mantel up on the block/feature above you which provides a nice no hands rest. Clip a bolt and check out the tricky traverse to the leaning crack.    Bust out a short crimpy boulder problem, 5.11, and make a few hard moves up the crack to get established on a foot rail. Recovery is key since the next ten feet are tips! Red C3 fits best since green aliens are too big. The crack is quite off-set so heel hooks and tricky foot work are possible. Once you pass the small bush, the crack changes corners again and gets steeper. It quickly goes to rattly fingers (.5 camalots) and the feet disappear. Luckily the crack is pretty sharp and you can get opposition with your thumb. Fight your way up the leaning crack until a hand jam pod, where you can catch a rest.    The crack thins back down to fingers, but by now you should be quite pumped and wishing a good foot would magically appear. After a few moves your prayer is answered in the way of a thin hand jam and the notion that you have almost done it. Grr your way up a few more fingerlocks and until you can reach a hand crack that takes you the rest of the way to the anchor. Belay at two bolts on a small ledge and enjoy the pump that goes all the way to the bone.         Start off with enjoyable thin hands off the belay until you must switch to the left crack. Climb up the grainy rock on your left which goes from  thin hands to hands. Catch a rest, clip a bolt and navigate over some scary stacked blocks. Despite the detached appearance the blocks stay in place and you are soon greeted with a splitter wide crack. Fist jam up clean granite making sure to bump along your #4 camalot. Eventually difficulty eases and you get a rest on a short slab. Another #4 camalot can go in here or you can run it out until you can place a finger sized piece in a thin crack on the left. Dual cracks lead up with plentiful gear options until you pass another wide section of crack. Laybacking seems to be the best option here and eventually the crack thins to nothing. Make a hero reach from the last finger lock to a perfect jug.  A few easy moves leads to a two bolt anchor on a reasonable ledge.      Start climbing up the wide crack until you can see a line of three bolts with black hangers. The original line continues further up the wide crack  before cutting left on a ladder with mix of rivets and 1/4 inch bolts. The free line joins the aid ladder at the last bolt (which was upgraded to 3/8\").    Climb a series of small ledges angling up and to the left past the three bolts. A combination of mantels and  trickery will get you to the highest foot rail. Make a long reach to clip a bolt and get established on the slab. The holds get progressively better and you work back to the right to another bolt (which is the end of the aid ladder). From here follow the bottom of a flake to the left via underclings. Gear in a crack to the right can protect the crux  reach to thin seams/crimps on the face.  The flake you are climbing gets steeper and eventually a series of good fingerlocks leads to a two bolt belay at hanging stance. The belay is more comfortable if you throw a finger sized piece or nut in the crack to your right.         Steep fingerlocks off the belay lead to a tricky bulge and a good stance. Continue layabacking up the stellar corner passing an occasional section of rattly  fingers. Make sure to milk the rests before the crack runs out and there is a bolt. Execute a cruxy reach to good hold on the face, or do some ninja stemming. Clip a second bolt, and boulder up on face holds. Once you get your feet situated you can reach left to a flake system which will take you back into the main corner. When the corner crack pinches out make use of the thin finger crack on the left and execute a final tricky sequence. Move carefully past a loose tooth and traverse right to a nice sloping ledge with two bolts.      From the belay work up the thin corner until you can clip a bolt on the left wall. Balance/slab climb with difficulty, until you can make use of a thin crack on the left wall. Follow this as it becomes a finger crack and then pinches out. A few tricky moves are required before you can reach the next section of finger crack. Keep stemming up the golden rock until you can move left. Easy terrain leads to a belay on a sloping ledge with two bolts.         From the belay climb the dirty wide hands crack until you get to a loose block. Step left and climb up to the obvious left leaning roof. Climb this, extending all your pieces, and pull around past a small stump. Layback and jam up an easy crack until you can reach a dirty ledge. Reach high for a small flake and make a committing move on to the face. Follow the seam to an obvious wide pod, which takes a #3 camalot. Continue up the seam at 5.10 until you reach a ledge covered in manzanita.  Continue straight up various low angle cracks and aim for a shiny bolt.  Climb on the right side of the bolt slicky stemming up to a good rail. A few more easy moves lead to a ledge.   Belay to the right of a tree with red bark on a ledge with hand sized gear in a flake. This is about 20\\' above the bolt .      Climb up past a few loose block  until you can step left towards a \"chimney\". Find a thin flake on the right which becomes a fun hand crack. When the flake pinches out step left to an obvious crack in a corner. Undercling across a small roof and gas it past  a tricky section. Face climb up to the right, past occasional cracks towards a clump of manzanita bushes. Pass the bushes on the right side to access a small ledge with a large tree on the right.  Belay here.      From the belay trend left along a nice low angle crack system. After about 40 feet the crack pitches out and you will need to step left to a hidden flake, follow this up passing a short roof and head towards some small trees.  Follow the past of least resistance as you head towards the summit. It seems best to follow the left leaning  gully/crack system towards a large tree. This pitch is low angle and has some moss and sand, tread carefully.    Belay at bigest tree you can reach at the end of your rope.    There is still about 200-300 feet of easy scrambling to the summit. It is best to un-rope at the big tree and walk up the manzanita and slabs in your approach shoes.',\n",

Pitch 1 - 5.10 - 160 feet     Start up a thin dihedral with a bush at the start, then out or around a small A-frame roof to another dihedral with thin to good fingers to a 2 bolt belay (only bolted belay on the climb).    Pitch 2 - 5.11+, 150 feet - 4 bolts     Traverse up and right to a bolt then continues right to a crumbly corner (5.7), then to a good ledge and three bolts (crux) traversing to the right to a ledge at the base of a dihedral.  Belay takes hand-size gear.    Pitch 3 - 5.11+, 70 feet     Head straight up the dihedral to the start of the flake system, then undercling to the left into a radical sustained undercling fingerlock traverse to a ledge with a tree.  Belay takes hand-size gear and a #4 BD.    Pitch 4 - 5.11+, 90 feet    Undercling/jam out the awkward flake to pumpy hand jams then powerful liebacking passed 4 fixed nuts.  Belay at a stance as the flake turns lower angle, or better yet, combine with Pitch 5.  Belay takes finger- and thin hand-size gear.    Pitch 5 - 5.11, 50 feet    Continue up the flake to a thin crack crux through a short roof.  Belay on a good sloping ledge.  Belay takes hand-size gear.    Pitch 6 - 12-, 130 feet    Jam/lieback up the wide slightly expando pancake flake (5.9) saving a #4 BD for the belay.

Climb up a juggy flake, clip another bolt out right and then traverse up and over to the arete. Climb past an undercling with an old smashed-up wasp nest, and then you get into the business.    The crux is a V3 boulder problem below the penultimate bolt. The Reid Guide is confusing because it\\'s description for the route is \"When in doubt, stay right\", and there\\'s some slopers and features out right, above a copperhead. But this is harder than it looks, and makes for a scary fall. You actually want to stay on the left side of the arete, and use sidepull edges along a seam in opposition to the arete.    After the crux is a bit more of 5.11 \\'don\\'t-blow-it-now\\' climbing past one more bolt to the anchor.

Climb out the small bulge on good finger locks then fire the crux where the locks get bad for a move. Some more 5.11 climbing leads up to and over a small roof. The finish after the final bolt is sort of devious and pumpy (spoiler alert: match the jug out right and reach up near the mossy crack).    This has fun moves and is a more natural line than it looks from the ground. Not as classic as most of the other 12's at Pub San, but definitely worth getting on.

Pitch 1 (5.11d): Just to the right of the crux pitch of the Regular route is a finger- to off-finger crack. While slightly less steep than its neighbor, the awkward size and poor feet make it considerably harder. Climb this and then switch cracks, continuing up to a 2-bolt belay in a bay bush.    Pitch 2 (5.10b): Climb flakes up to a slowly widening crack, starting with hands and going all the way to 5\". Continue past the small roof and build a gear anchor right after this in a finger crack. This pitch is hard for the grade (I suggest 5.10c) and takes all sizes of gear.    Pitch 3 (5.11a): Climb up to the enormous, can\\'t-miss-it offwidth. Sustained armbarring and eventually stacking will get you to where it pinches down to hand-size. Carefully traverse left to the Pitch 6 belay on the Regular route. You\\'ll want to pull out all of the wide arsenal for this. The guidebook says 5.11a but I thought it was about 5.10d.    From here, you have several choices for your 4th pitch.     Option 1, leftmost: This pitch is called the Excellent Adventure. I haven\\'t done this, but it takes you up a finger crack to the Rostrum Roof. (5.13)    Option 2, center: This is pitch 7 of the Regular route, starting up the Guano cave, up to the hanging flake, then  continuing up and left into a very overhanging corner with pumpy handjamming. (5.11b)    Option 3, rightmost: This is the original Blind Faith finish. Start as with the handcrack, but when you get to the hanging flake bust right into a flare. Belay at the top of this or if you like, continue up the P8 offwidth to the top. (5.10d)    Pitch 5:    Option 1, leftmost: Original Regular route finish. Don\\'t really know much about it except that it goes at 5.12b.    Option 2, center: The Alien finish. Also 5.12b.    Option 3, rightmost: Depending on how you did the last pitch, you may or may not have to traverse under the roof until you are standing at the base of a right-facing corner.

Rap in to a sloping ledge with a bolted anchor at the base of the corner, then lead back out. You could also set some directionals and mini-traxion it if you wanted.    Starts with some good finger locks, then becomes really shallow and flared. Requires some \"laybacking\" as the name suggests. Placing pro is tricky, hard to see, and super strenuous. After pulling over onto a ledge, continue up the corner and gully on rock that is carpeted with lichen. Mantel out left at the very end to regain the ledge at the top of the rappels.    I ran a wire brush down the main corner crack, but it still needs a lot of cleaning. Most Bachar FA\\'s have gotten their ratings upgraded in guidebooks over the years. This is one of those obscure routes, like Moongerms, which has had few repeats and still retains the \"old-school\" rating (5.11b in the Reid Guide).

       "  'description': 'The Rostrum is a truly rad climb.  Every pitch is high quality and would be sought after individual classics were they at any crag, but stacked on top of each other they create a superb and memorable challenge.  The climbing is secure, well protected, and physical.      Park at the pullout along the stone wall, or just past it at a dirt pullout.  Follow the trail(which begins just west of the stone wall) down past some slabs and on to an obvious rappel point on a tree.  Two more raps (all with a single 60m) take you to within 25 feet of the base.    P1:  Ascend a large left-facing crack/flake system to a final 5.8 squeeze chimney with a wild exit move.  Belay above the maw at bolts.  It helps to step left at a tree halfway up this pitch.  5.9.    P2:  Three options.      1):  Downclimb ten feet and traverse left to a thin crack system.  This traverse is balancey with minimal hands and sloping feet.  Climb back up until level with the belay, place gear (black Alien helpful) and punch it up the thin layback/fingerlock crack until it is possible to stem right to a flake at which point the climbing eases.  Continue to a belay stance on blocks with a good pin.  5.11a.      2):  Ascend the aforementioned left-facing flake straight up from the belay.  This goes at 5.10- and is R without large gear.  It appears extremely secure, however.    3):  Ascend a 5.10d flare to the right of the belay.  This looks less appealing than the previous options.    P3:  A long pitch.  Perform a difficult layback move off the belay up into the hand crack system.  Climb amazing steep hands to a roof, lieback and jam up through the roof, and up yet another awesome handcrack to a final stretch of jugs that lead to the halfway ledge.    Belay at a pin on the ledge.  5.10.    P4:  The crux.  Climb an easy ramp to a stance immediately below the pumpy but locker splitter finger crack.  Up this for 25 feet to a thank-god hand jam and rest stance.  It\\'s hard to fully recover here unless you can get your knee in, but I suggest getting as much back as you can.  Launch into an extremely pumpy layback flake, past a pin, for another 20 feet.  The pump is cumulative but complete recovery is possible if you can pull over the top.  Clip the optional anchor and traverse straight left to a right-facing wall with a steep 5.9 hand crack.  Follow this up to a bolted belay.  5.11c.    P5:  Two options.      1):  Continue up the steep, slick right-facing corner with good jams separated by long reaches.  Pull around a small roof at the top.  Belay at bolts.  5.10d.      2):  \"The Uprising\".  Step right and climb the sick, overhanging hands & fists crack up the face right of the traditional line.  If you climb the Uprising, it makes a lot of sense to link it into the next pitch.  5.11.    P6:  Take the big cam out of the pack.  Tricky face climbing right leads to a steep crack on the arete.  At the top perform a difficult crack switch move to gain the 5.10 offwidth.  Solid knee locks, hand stacks, and pushing of a 4.5 Camalot (#5 C4) over your head will get you to the top.  I found it quite enjoyable, but others have called it the crux.  There is a bolt and other small pro available on this pitch, and strong OW climbers could do without the large cam -- but since you need it for the standard final pitch (and can place it on many other pitches), you may as well bring it.  Also, it makes for a truly stupendous pitch to link this OW into the next pitch -- just save your hand-size cams.  Otherwise, belay at bolts.  5.10.    P7:  Three options.      1)  The traditional (and apparently best) line is to mantle through a bit of bird shit and then climb up to a large, fin-shaped feature that sticks straight out of the wall.  Ascend the left side of this with wild jams to some great stem rests.  Belay at a bolt in the alcove under the final headwall.  Soft for 5.11b.      2)  Supposedly it is also possible to ascend the right side of this fin at 5.10d but it doesn\\'t seem as good.      3)  There\\'s also the \"Excellent Adventure\" variation but I didn\\'t even look at it.  I think that, as you climb up next to the fin, there\\'s a finger crack out left that can be followed diagonally up to under the final headwall.  5.13?    P8:  Three options.    1)  The most common finish is to traverse straight right on easy ground, then up into a final 5.9 offwidth.  There is a difficult (5.10+) move to gain the OW, but once you\\'re in it it is rather easy (especially compared to the offwidth below).  Your big cam will protect the first half of the crack, but be warned that if you leave it behind the rope frequently will drag the cam irretrievably into the crack.  It\\'s better to use it as long as possible, then pull it out, and gun for the top -- do not fall.  Belay at a fixed anchor on a tree.    2)  The Alien Finish heads straight out the roof at 5.12b.  From under the roof it is possible to place a 0.75 Camalot to protect the initial moves.  These involve powerful moves from a great jam to a good undercling to either a thin finger jam over the lip or a flake.  The difficulties continue beyond this as you ascend twin finger cracks up the steep headwall.  Eventually you must switch cracks (by some bolts) to the original finish -- it is possible to switch cracks lower down at an obvious chalked up flake.  The upper part of the pitch is sustained rattley fingers -- save gear for this!    3)  The original finish is just left of the Alien and is also 5.12b.  I haven\\'t climbed it and don\\'t know too much about it, other then that you hand traverse left under the roof to access it (or do the \"Excellent Adventure\").    From the summit block, rap down into the notch, then do 35 feet of 5.4-5.5 up the other side to get back on the trail up to the road.  It\\'s also worth noting that if you want to only do the top half of the climb, or need to bail after the first half, passage to and from the trail and halfway ledge is possible via a short 5.6 traverse.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This is a typical Yosemite gully thrash. There are a couple cruxes low down on the route that are interesting and challenging, but most of the climbing is unexposed and not very fun. It\\'s got lots of dirt and moss, but the bushwhacking isn\\'t too bad except for a pitch near the top. If you just want a mungeineering route up a wall that no one ever climbs to the top of, then go for it. If you want a gully with some actual good rock climbing, go do  or something. Oh, and don\\'t attempt this route if it has rained recently and it\\'s wet.    Approach by hiking up the climbers trail to the base of Manana, then follow the wall uphill to the right. Boulderfield Gorge is the massive gully in the corner where the west facing wall intersects the water-polished north facing wall. Pharaoh\\'s Beard should be visible a couple hundred feet to the right. On the left-hand wall inside the gully will be the overhanging 5.12 crack \"Lost and Found\".    The first few pitches lead up through three \"steps\" in the gully. Each step is guarded by a crux chockstone which must be climbed past. The first chockstone is passed on the left with some awkward jamming. The second chockstone requires some wild stemming and then a difficult mantel. The third chockstone is passed on the right with a \"pull-up\" move on a good hold. After some brief scrambling, climb onto a secondary ledge system on the left side of the gully. This avoids some mungey chimneys in the back of the main gully.    A couple more easy pitches tunnel behind two large chockstones to arrive at a debris strewn ledge below the \"Colossus\". This enormous chockstone (more of just an overhanging wall) is passed by climbing features on the right wall of the chimney. Start up a left facing OW flake, make a traverse right, then straight up on more flakes to a mungy ramp with another crux move.    Next is a rope-length of 3rd class up vegetated gully with ferns and thistles. Take the left gully. On the next pitch, step left to avoid scary looking chockstones and a dead snag, then bushwhack through a tree choked chimney. A couple rope-lengths of 4th class lead to the shoulder of the wall.    To descend:   Option 1: Rap down the main face of the wall. Two ropes are maybe required. Bring lots of webbing and stuff to leave as you will probably be establishing most of the rappels. If you can make it to the top of King Tut\\'s Tomb, it\\'s only 3 double rope raps to the ground from there.    Option 2: Bushwhack east and then north through breaks in the cliffs to reach the Valley rim. Hike cross-country to meet up with the Pohono Trail, which you can take to Glacier Point and either hitchhike back or walk down the 4-mile.',\n",

       "  'description': 'This route climbs the right side of the 500ft tower located directly above Manana. It\\'s dirty but has a couple redeeming pitches. The rock is mostly good and the climbing is mostly well protected. Gets morning shade. The Reid Guide calls it 5.10b, but doesn\\'t list any info on the FFA. Galen Rowel surely used aid on his 1968 ascent, and the green Roper guide lists the route as 5.9 A1. So I don\\'t know where the 10b rating comes from, but the crux pitch felt harder than The Sceptor (11a) to me.    We did a direct start by climbing a gully just to the right of Manana. It\\'s possible to avoid these first two pitches by hiking uphill to the west and then cutting back left on 3rd/4th class ledges to reach the base of pitch 3. I\\'ll describe the route as we climbed it, so the pitches will differ from what is in the Reid topo.    Pitch 1 (10a/b) Climb up the gully past a big tree and a ledge. The chimney pinches you out and you must make a couple big reaches between jams to get situated in the crack system above. Burly. Then follow the 6\" crack a bit to the right and cut back left to belay on a big ledge.    Pitch 2 (4th class) Do a little boulder problem to get up on the next ledge, and then follow the broad ledge system along the base of the wall for about 80ft to the right. Scramble up some more easy terrain and belay at the highest ledge.    Pitch 3 (5.8) A short pitch following the crack system up and left. Climb the double cracks with some stemming onto a big 30-degree slab. Walk to the back of the slab and belay at the base of the corner. The anchor takes nuts and 1-2\" cams.    Pitch 4 (5.9) Bushwhack past a small tree and then climb up the enjoyable steep corner. This would be a nice pitch if it were clean. This brings you up onto another tree covered ledge. You can belay here, or climb a bit further through a short steep section. There is a dirty crack a bit to the right which is undercut at the bottom and looks really hard to get into. I think this is perhaps the best way to go? I got off route here and climbed the crack just to the left which gains a long narrow ledge. The climbing above was hard and poorly protected so I followed the ledge all the way to the left near the arete and a small tree. I climbed up 20 ft and then traversed way back right on unprotected face climbing and features (5.4 R/X) to rejoin the route. My follower was able to climb directly up on toprope since I didn\\'t place pro anywhere on my round-a-bout variation. Whichever way you go, there is a good spot to build an anchor (nuts and small to medium cams) at the base of the steep crack and a place to sit on the big ledge immediately to the right.    Pitch 5 (5.11a) Another pitch which would be really fun if it were clean. Climb up the steep hand and fist crack. It is easier than it appears thanks to several large features to grab and step on. This brings you to another ledge. It\\'s probably a good idea to belay here if you didn\\'t climb all the way to the base of the crack on pitch 4. Otherwise keep going into the crux \"10b\" pitch. This section is just as steep and dirty as the previous, but also much thinner and less featured. Continuous climbing in a right-leaning corner and crack with a very pumpy finish. Move left along the sandy debris covered ledges and belay by some blocks under a roof.    Pitch 6 (5.8) A short bit of insecure climbing up the thin crack and face reaches a horizontal crack below the roof. Traverse right to where the roof is split by a chimney and wiggle up to the top of the formation.',\n",

You can belay here if you want or link this with the 3rd pitch if the rope drag\\'s not too bad.    Claw your way through the tree (this one\\'s much more difficult than the first) and enter a chimney. Pass a chockstone and then tunnel up behind the last portion of the formation to the summit.

Pull through a cruxy sequence on face holds and sidepulls to gain the next crack system above, then climb easier terrain to the top.    The rap anchor is off a tree, and is shared with Vanishing Point. ',\n",

       "  'description': 'The Steck-Salathe truly deserves its status as one of the \"Fifty Classic Climbs of North America\". Everything from the climbing itself to the many stories of adventure had on the north face of the Sentinel makes this climb a must-do for any aspiring Valley climber -- if not a route to be repeated again and again, it certainly should at least be seen as a rite of passage. The climb\\'s reputation for being long, wide, and physical is well deserved, but the quality of that climbing, the position one achieves, and the overall sense of adventure the route offers should not be understated.  On the first ascent in 1950 Allen Steck and John Salathe reached the top of the Flying Buttress (the first half of the route) in two days, and took another three to reach the summit (Royal Robbins made the second and third ascents a few years later). Today the route is commonly done by free-soloists in the lesser part of a morning; but this is also the climb that nearly resulted in the deaths of Dean Potter and Timmy O\\'Neill (a fantastic account of their antics appeared in one of the climbing mags a few years back), and did take the life of beloved Derek Hersey. Most parties should expect a very full day even with a first light start, but fast parties could certainly make it down for dinner if they move efficiently and link pitches. Originally rated 5.9, the route has been upgraded to 5.10b which is much more like it. Nevertheless, the 5.10 sections aren\\'t too bad -- it\\'s all those 5.8 and 5.9 wide pitches that present the true crux of the route. There are many ways to pitch out this climb; this description describes my experience on it.  Approach by parking at the Four Mile Trailhead. Follow this trail for a long half-mile to a point on the trail where a narrow, tree-shrouded talus slope heads up into the woods. This is sometimes marked by a cairn, but it is fairly easy to find: if in doubt, continue east on the main trail for a minute or two to an obvious stream bed (sometimes dry late in the season) and then backtrack 100-200 feet to the talus. Head up a well-defined climber\\'s trail in the talus until it eventually dead-ends at the base of the Sentinel at a steep, wide, west-trending ramp. This is a convenient place to rack up and stash the packs. Follow this ramp up until it eventually turns into a narrow system of catwalk-like ledges that weave back and forth up the north face of the Sentinel. This amazing passage (reminiscent of the approach to Hobbit Book in Tuolumne) gains about 1/3 of the height of the Sentinel via simple 3rd and 4th class scrambling. It\\'s hard to get lost on this ramp system, and eventually it opens up to a small, loose area near the western edge of the face. Continue scrambling up until you reach the base of a significant right-facing corner with, yes, a wide crack. This is the start of the route -- you can\\'t scramble any higher.  P1: A 60\\' right-facing corner with a wide crack in it. This can be negotiated with squeezing and OW skills, but I found it easier to lieback. 5.8, strenuous. I was glad to have a #4.5 Camalot (#5 C4). This leads to a belay stance which I skipped. Step right and continue up some 5.8 cracks to another stance and belay -- a long pitch.  P2: Climb a touch more 5.8 past some fixed gear, then easier terrain, then a brief finger crack, then wandering climbing up a gully system to some final wide cracks and a belay below the base of the Wilson Overhang. Another long pitch, 5.8.  P3: The Wilson Overhang. Climb up an ever-steepening chimney/corner system with a difficult to reach hand crack in the back. Eventually one must commit to either jamming and squeezing awkwardly or stemming out a ways with little pro. There are good face holds for doing the latter. Pull the overhang and climb easier ground up to a belay on a pedestal. This pitch is accurately rated 5.10a but is not the crux of the climb.  P4: Climb up an absolutely horrendous 5.9 squeeze and then traverse right and up to a belay at the base of a huge gully/chute system. Alternatively (highly recommended), skip the squeeze in favor of an unprotected 5.8 flake out right. The squeeze may very well be the crux of the route -- UGH.  P5 & P6: Climb one of many crack systems for the next two pitches up the gully/chute until it is possible to tunnel through the tip of the Flying Buttress to the left. This is a good area to simulclimb or pass other parties as there are many avenues. 5.8-5.10 depending on how you go. Belay at a rap station on the east side of the Flying Buttress -- this is the halfway point and after this retreat becomes more difficult. Do a short (40\\') rap off the anchor to another anchor at the base of a steep crack system. I guess you can also downclimb this section? Looked difficult.  P7: Ascend the steep and difficult crack system up to an obvious belay -- this is an interesting and challenging pitch. 5.9.  P8: Face climb up and right, then wander sharply back left and up to a belay below a long corner/slot that leads up into The Narrows. There are several fixed pieces protecting this pitch, but small/medium wires work well too. 5.9 and a somewhat heady change of pace from all the thrutching thus far. Don\\'t worry -- its all thrutching the rest of the way from here.  P9: This corner to flare to chimney is rated 5.10b which would lead one to believe its the crux of the climb, but it goes quite well, especially if you\\'re willing to leave the security of the gear in the corner and stem and chimney your way up it a little to the outside. The pitch links very easily into the next pitch, the Narrows, and this is what we did.  P10: The Narrows. If you skipped the 5.9 squeeze after the Wilson Overhang in favor of the 5.8 flake, then this is the unquestionable crux of the route. The Narrows was originally climbed by aiding up a bolt ladder on the outside of the slot, but ever since Robbins\\' ascents, the way to go has been right up into that hole. Approaching it, unlike Astroman\\'s Harding Slot, is relatively easy. In fact, you can get most of your upper body into the Narrows while your lower body is still comfortably back-footing in the wider chimney below. The problem is advancing the next yard or so: One must drop one\\'s feet and figure out some way to make upwards progress in a squeeze chimney using only body parts from the hips up. I managed this by using the back of my head on the back wall to pull my body upwards while simultaneously exhaling, then taking a deep breath to hold that position while I groped for a higher purchase with the back of my head. Hey, it worked. Gear for inside The Narrows really isn\\'t necessary, but a fist-size cam (#3.5 Camalot/#4 C4) works well to protect the initial moves. For most of this you feel pretty alone with only the sound of your own gasping, and the tinkling sound of the hangers on the old aid bolts blowing freely in the wind on the outside of the slot, for company. Perhaps you\\'ll wish you were out there hanging from those bolts, but perservere -- eventually things will start going a little more quickly. At last you can stem up out of The Narrows to an incredibly exposed position high on the upper face of the Sentinel. Peer down at the old bolt ladder, and the valley floor two thousand feet below. A few more feet of easy climbing leads to a nice belay. 5.9? Yeah, sure.  P11: At this point a stout looking pine tree appears way above. This actually is the location of the final real belay on the climb. Not much further, huh? Continue up a fun 5.7 chimney to a very cool belay at bolts on top of a chockstone.  P12: Continue up the chimney until forced to pull out left through a steep section at a hangerless bolt (plenty of gear to back it up). Belay where convenient. 5.8.  P13: Aim for the tree. Head up and left through a very steep, but short, section of hand or fist cracks (switching between them where necessary). Some of this rock is fairly low quality, but after one last little mantle into the dirt and pine needles, you can taste victory. Belay at the big tree.  P14: An easy pitch continues up the east-trending ramp at low 5th class, then steps around the corner and belays just below the summit.  Descent: Before attempting this descent for the first time, take into account the amount of daylight you have remaining. If it\\'s dark already, consider waiting it out and beginning at first light. You should try to do at least the first two thirds of the descent in the daylight. Part 1: Follow a passage east through manzanita and boulders until it turns into a huge gully that heads down to the east. Follow the obvious trail along the southern (right) wall of this gully until it eventually begins switching back down the center. This gully is often loose and very steep at times and requires much care to follow the trail, which is the easiest path. At one point a rappel is reached, but this is not necessary -- there is a 4th/low-5th passage down just before reaching the rap, but it appears improbable from above. Eventually you will reach a stream which must be crossed. Note: This stream is the one that crosses the Four Mile Trail just after the talus on the approach; it is also visible (as water streaks/wet sections of rock) from Camp 4 when looking up at the valley wall just left (east) of the Sentinel. The stream is spring-fed and safe to drink from -- a good thing to know when planning for how much water to carry on the climb. Part 2: After crossing the stream, begin heading north (left) on steep slabs. You want to stay in the middle of the slab or western 1/2 of it (near the Sentinel). The base of the slabs terminate in dense trees. Part 3: Continue scrambling down and east (right) along the base of the slabs to a non-descript point at which you enter the trees. Find the path of least resistance -- expect some bushwhacking. You can more or less head north and west to reach the climber\\'s trail and the Four Mile Trail, but if you left equipment at the base of the ramp, you\\'ll have to cut sharply back west to reach that point.',\n",

       "  'description': 'Over the summer of 2014, Jake Whittaker and I put up a new free route approximately 100 yards left of Widow\\x92s Tears amphitheater. We called the climb The Lurch (7 pitches, 5.12c/d), after one of the last moves on the route\\x97by far the crux.       The Lurch follows an obscure, unknown aid line that may be from the \\x9290s, judging by the bolts at some anchors. Our line veers from the aid route in a few places to allow for free climbing and/or avoiding death. For example, a leftward traverse on the fourth pitch avoids monstrous and very precariously stacked, Volkswagen-size chunks of granite.    This route is characterized by quality stone, quality climbing, and relative safety. It\\x92s a great route to throw oneself at if pushing the grade. And if you don\\x92t climb 12+, this might be a good one to see where you\\x92re at\\x97you can really go for it at the cruxes. The seven pitches go at 10+, 11a/b, 12b, 11c/d, 10c, 12a, and 12c/d, and some are short for ease of belays and diminishing rope drag on the hard sections. Overall, the route is PG, but the cruxes are as G as G can be.    At the top of this no-summit, silly little route tucked into an obscure corner of the Ditch, climbers will be rewarded with a secluded, stunningly gorgeous perch where they can sit in peace, breathe, and take in the overall contentment that only accompanies climbing routes longer than a few pitches.    Thank you Jake Whittaker, for this fun filled time.  You taught me so much on this one.    Here is a beta video on the crux.   ',\n",

       "  'description': \"Approach: Park at Wawona Tunnell parking lot and walk down highway 41 towards Yosemite Valley. Look for a large talus field that leads up to the Widow's Tears Amphiteater. Hike up towards the amphiteater, pass the large road that runs horizontal to the approach and cut right when you reach the base of the wall that forms a buttress on the right side of the waterfall. Continue walking west at the base of the wall till you can scramble up and right on 3rd and 4th class ledges. When you gain some elevation and hit vertical walls, turn east and find the base of the route. There is a large tree right across from it. Yes, you will really have to climb over that giant roof that looms above.    P1. Jam, lay-back, and do some off-fingers jamming for 70 feet. There is a fixed piton which is backed up by cams for the belay. 5.10a (felt no easier than 5.10c pitch higher up)   p2. Climb over the giant roof. Helps to be able to do a pull up on fingerjams. Also, helps to not place gear above the lip of the roof so you can use it for jamming. After you figure it out traverse right and belay at the tree. 5.11a 70 feet. Felt harder than 11a.   p3. Traverse back left from the tree and to the base of the giant dihedral. 80 ft 5.8   p4. Overhanging corner with hand jamming, fists and thin hands to cap it off. Bring a variety of cams from BD#1 to #4. 0.75s are good for building an anchor on top of the pitch. 120 feet, 5.11a - physical.    p5. Climb up the zig-zagging thin hands and off fingers crack. Great climbing and fun moves. 120 feet 5.10c.   Now you are on top of Windfall.     P6. Scramble left and up to a dirty chimney. 5.7 chimney that feels hard till you look around and find more features all around you. Climb up and belay at the base of a short headwall with a splitter crack. 150ft   P7. Climb over to the top of the short headwall and traverse a bit left. Best to skip placing pro till you get to the base of the AWESOME 5.10c crack. It starts from BD #0.75 (green) size. It would be even better to belay at the base to avoid rope drag, but make sure you have a few extra .75s for the belay. This pitch accepts lots of finger and mid size pieces, bring nuts. Great pitch. 150 ft from the ledge at the base of the headwall.   P8. Climb up the white headwall and into a wide crack to your left. Make sure to bring your #4 cams. 140 ft 5.10a. Belay past the tree below the chockstone. Wild belay spot.   P9. Squeeze chimney with sparse pro. Don't fall till you place your first pro 25ft up or so. Continue up via enjoyable chimneying. 5.8/9 120ft. Belay from trees at the base of a little forest.   P10. Scramble over the 200ft section of forest and bushwhacking. 4th class ledges in places. WOuld be hard to fall off here though because concentration of bushes is far greater than exposure.    P11. There is a jamcrack that starts from an obvious corner. You will see a beautiful fistcrack that marks the end of the route higher up, so climb towards it. 120ft 5.8. Stop at thebase of a corner with a lieback.   p12. Do a few burly layback moves and get on the ledge with a little tree growing on the west side of the ledge. This tree seemed like the best pro that could be used to protect the slab traverse (5.10a) which starts up from the eastern side of the ledge. Pay attention to your foot work and don't blow it. Continue up the wide crack to the top of the route 160 ft.    Descent: Scramble over to the top of Stanford point, take a bunch of photos, and walk down to Wawona Tunnell using a perfect class 1 trail. One of the best descents I have done.\",\n",

The route is on the buttress that forms the right side of the amphitheater.     Look for a large, deep natural drainage down off the right side of the road - it's a ways down the road. Start hiking uphill just past this drainage. Go uphill through trees and mossy boulders until you reach an old roadbed that runs parallel to Highway 41.     A few cairns on the old road mark the spot to continue uphill. If you don't see them just continue uphill through a large talus field trending towards the right side of the formation. We found it easiest to follow the talus drainage all the way to the base of the wall, a few hundred meters right of the start of the route. This makes for an easier traverse over to the base.     Descent: You can rap Windfall with a single 70m rope in three rappels. As of 10/2014, the first rap anchor, at the top of the 10c splitter, consists of two nice fixed nuts and a sling.

Start on the low sloping rail and move left to a couple of mediocre crimps.  Do a big throw to a sharp but slightly incut crimper flake followed by a couple of easy crimping sequences on decent hands/feet.  Core up to the sloper rail, mantle said rail, and don't biff the easy 5th class slab to the top.    There's also a left variation called Thunderhead which holds the same grade.  Thunderbird seems the physically harder of the two (though I personally have not sent Thunderhead).\",\n",

P. 3: Climb up the steeper wall directly above the belay, stepping first a bit left and then back right, to join a smaller right-arching corner and crack system. Follow the crack until it fades out, at the base of a field of big knobs. Climb the knobs (not hard, but no protection to speak of) up and a bit left to a ledge and bolted anchor. 5.7-, 170'.    Rappel the route with two ropes. The crack system continues up through the summit visor, but the rock quality deteriorates a bit.    A quality route.

Start on the finger crack on the left side, then step over to the hand crack on the right side. Above the tree, the crack widens from hand to fist to off width. The angle of the rock is low and it is very easy to place good pro almost anywhere on the route.    Clever pro placement to the right of the small tree half-way up avoids dragging the rope through the tree (which is covered with sap).    Several fun top-\\xadropes are possible from the anchors.

       "  'description': 'Grand Central is a 6-pitch route that reaches the summit of the North Buttress. The route is 5.7 or easier, except for five short sections ranging from 5.8 to 5.10a. The 5.10a crux is a short overhanging hand crack on pitch 6. The route is Grade III 5.10a or 5.9 C1 PG13.  (1)5.7. 165 feet. 1 bolt. Follow a series of single and parallel cracks to where they end to the left of a large roof (5.4 - 5.6). Traverse up and slightly right to join a long crack fifteen feet above the large roof on the right. As this crack ends, climb up and right to the anchor with bolt-protected 5.7 face climbing which is the crux of the first pitch.  (2)5.8. 150 feet. 5 bolts. Climb past two bolts (some 5.8) to a small dihedral. Step up left to a ramp and another bolt. Ascend slightly up and left to another bolt on a face. Diagonal up and to the right below the obvious small bush to a ledge with a bolt. This ledge is slightly higher and to the right (looking up) of the small bush. Climb 5.8 face to the belay.  (3)5.8. 180 feet. Face climb (8 bolts) to anchor at base of The Ramp.  (4)5.7. 190 feet. 3 bolts. Climb The Ramp using a combination of the crack and face climbing. There is a bolt where the crack becomes a seam and two more bolts near the end of the pitch. The belay is on a good stance next to some small trees. Extending all the pro with slings is highly recommended.  (5) 5.9. 140 feet. 4 bolts. From the belay move up a few feet above the belay bolts and then traverse right above the trees by the belay to a bolt below a small tapering roof. Go around or over the bottom of the roof and then up past two bolts to a thin crack which leads up and right. Follow the crack (protected with an old fixed piton and small cams) until it ends then delicately ascend (5.9) to a bolt. From here climb mostly straight up until coming to a ledge. The anchors are to the left/north on the ledge. Extending all the pro with slings is highly recommended.  (6)5.10a or 5.7-5.8 C1. 190 feet. 1 bolt. Ascend slightly up and left from the belay to a bolt (5.7-5.8). Climb from here up a sloping ramp to the obvious corner above and to the right of the belay. Ascend the crack (5.10a) by jamming/lie-backing. This crack can also be aided at C1. An optional belay can be placed just above the crack to better protect the follower. Continue right/south along the ramp until the wall above it ends, and it is possible to exit up to the ridge. There are several belay points within twenty feet above the end of the wall.  From the last belay, scramble about 100 feet of easy 3rd class to the top.   (refer to 3 beta photos): After topping out on the ridge, go up the ridge about 100 yards and follow some easy ledges/slabs down and left (east).  As you descend, aim for the solitary, ~20\\x92 tree that has no lower branches, a roughly light tan trunk, and one dead branch pointing straight up. From the tree, diagonal down towards the very obvious, large dead tree that is just beyond the edge of the slab at the bottom of the ridge.  From the lower tree, work over and down to within a few hundred feet of the top edge of the buttress. You may find a line of cairns here which lead down to the base of the buttress. Hike down around the east side of the buttress. No down-\\xadclimbing is necessary (stay away from the edge).  At the base of the buttress where the slabs meet the talus, there are some choices: (1) A quick traverse through the top of the talus leads back around to the center of the Buttress and the JMT. (2) Traverse around the bottom of the talus field and then work over to the base of the buttress or the JMT. (3) Continue down through the east edge of the burned area and traverse back over and up (roughly northwest) to the JMT at the point where you first see the Buttress when you are coming up the JMT from the parking lot.',\n",

Start by climbing a steep handcrack until you gain a small stance on the pillar itself. Clip a mangled rusty piton , you can also fiddle a small cam or nut in to backup the pin. This is the last pro on the route.    Make some exposed face moves to gain another small ledge . From here you are fully committed on the pillar. You must make two distinct 5.9 moves on mostly positive knobs to reach the summit jugs on top.    There is (1) old quarter inch bolt on top with a newer looking quick link through it. You can bring up a second from the top. To descend, run the rope through the quick link , and then run the rope around a solid horn on top. You can safely rap from the bolt and horn.    Panic Pillar is an excellent adventure after a Cathedral summit or on your way to Eichorn. It is a pretty serious lead, and the fall potential near the top should not be underestimated.',\n",

However you start, after 3 pitches, steadily increasing from 5.3 to 5.6, you'll probably be funneled into a chimney.  It can get crowded here, and a backpack can be a real pain.

I think the name is also fitting because of its proximity to Bombs Over Tokyo, but either way, Blown Away is absolutely classic.    P1:  Climb the first pitch of West Crack.  5.9.    P2:  Climb through the roof of West Crack\\'s second pitch, then continue up the OW for a ways before departing the crack and moving left at a bolt to a bolted belay.  5.8.    P3:  Climb a splendid rising traverse pitch across the beautiful face.  This pitch passes ten bolts or so and generally aims for a ledge on the left margin of the wall.  Be careful to follow the right line -- there is another route (Weenie Roast) that intersects this one and you don\\'t want to stray onto it.  Belay on this ledge with gear and a lone bolt.  5.9.    P4:  Climb the incredible, exposed arete with gear and bolts up through the hanging dihedral.  Belay at bolts over the roof.    P5:  An easy romp to the top.',\n",

       "  'description': 'A classic 4-5 pitch dihedral with all types of crack climbing but mainly liebacking and finger locks. This is another great route on Daff that gets plenty of summer afternoon sun.  Three starting options exist; the original 5.9 dihedral that passes a fun roof to an awkward and physical slot then sweet jams - a great pitch, what appears to be a runout 5.9 face to easy crack pitch with one bolt or a 5.7 crack with steep face to enter it. The first two options lead to the same fixed anchor (tat with a rap ring) and the third option is a gear belay on a decent ledge.  From the fixed anchor at the end of the first pitch you should continue the second pitch left past easy jamming with lots of knob footholds until a 5.8 traverse at a big hand hold / pod in the crack allows a crack switch left about 5 feet, this is exciting for the second. Alternatively you can make a 20 foot rappel to the top of the 5.7 crack or down climb to it 5.7. The second pitch ends at huge ledge. The optional 5.7 crack first pitch start avoids the exciting traverse for your partner on the second pitch.  The third pitch jams and laybacks up a wonderful corner to belay at a small stance, easy 5.9 with #3 camalot belay.   Fourth pitch runs up to a large loose flake then underclings the quick 5.10- crux (small offset stoppers or tiny cams) to more good jamming. Belay at the top of the dihedral to watch your partner or continue to the top with easy safe climbing.',\n",

Belay at the ledge, not at the fixed pins 12 feet up recommended by supertopo.   : go up the squeeze at .7, clip the pins with a long runner, traverse out the roof into the slick corner. Awkward fingers and hip scumming up, then out another roof. 100', lots of sustained .9.   : off the ledge with the hangarless bolt, up and out the roof, then up another slick corner with very awkward hands. Up to a huge ledge. sustained awkward .9, 60 feet.    I combined 2 and 3 no problem with a 60m rope and a double cam rack with a single #3. ledge is huge and comfy.   : guidebook crux. mostly .7 and .8 slab. Hard part is getting gear in the seam on the corner/roof. It's there, but it's thin and placing it can be strenuous. The crux move felt like .10a slab, and is well protected on both sides. Then fun knob climbing past a pin to the belay.   : easy 5th to the top.   : follow cairns to the east side of the dome. Big ledge with a tree. Chains on top of a huge block. 2 raps with a 60m to the ground. maybe 1 rap with a 70?    Agreed that the sustained .9 is harder than the single crux move.\",\n",
