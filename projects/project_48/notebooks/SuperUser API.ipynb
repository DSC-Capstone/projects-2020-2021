       "   'body_markdown': 'I am currently running the Debian testing branch (bullseye at the time of writing) and I already created and confirmed the functionality of an ```.xsessionrc``` file for the purposes of changing the ```PATH``` variable for my whole session each time; the ```PATH``` variable being used to also point to a local bin folder. I was and am under the impression that a file at ```~/.xsessionrc``` was the only way to have your DM set environmental variables for the entire login, whereas files like ```~/.bash_profile``` or ```~/.bashrc``` could at best be done for the entirety of a single shell or terminal emulator being opened. For whatever it might matter, I am using LXDE with Openbox although I am fairly certain it doesn&#39;t really matter as most versions of Debian seem to work about the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is the entire contents of my ```~/.xsessionrc``` file:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nexport XDG_DATA_DIRS=&quot;/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS&quot;\\r\\n\\r\\nexport PATH=&quot;$HOME/Archive/OS/Applications/.bin:$PATH&quot;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAgain, the ```PATH``` variable updates but ```XDG_DATA_DIRS``` doesn&#39;t seem to do anything. I was only interested in changing the ```XDG_DATA_DIRS``` variable because of a blurb of text that showed up when trying to install Discord over ```flatpak``` in the terminal:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nNote that the directories \\r\\n\\r\\n&#39;/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share&#39;\\r\\n&#39;/home/animerrill/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share&#39;\\r\\n\\r\\nare not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so\\r\\napplications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the\\r\\nsession is restarted.\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd since the .desktop files for flatpak programs are automatically installed into those folders, I wanted to incorporate them through any means other than doing a ton of symbolic links manually every time I want to install a new flatpak program. Ideally, one would want to use the provided .desktop file since the dev probably knows what they&#39;re doing in regards to their own program a lot of the time. Just for full clarity, the main reason I am concerned about this is because it&#39;s the easiest way to have them appear in the shortcut menus, and also as such be used for shortcut icons and stuff.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust to drive home the point, here is the output of both variables during the current session:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nanimerrill@debian-laptop:~$ echo PATH: $PATH &amp;&amp; echo XDG_DATA_DIRS: $XDG_DATA_DIRS\\r\\nPATH: /home/animerrill/Archive/OS/Applications/.bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games\\r\\nXDG_DATA_DIRS: /usr/local/share:/usr/share:/usr/share/gdm:/var/lib/menu-xdg:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/usr/share/gdm/:/var/lib/menu-xdg/\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHonestly I&#39;m just more confused than anything. I assume, much like with a lot of other quirks about Linux, that I am just not in on the exact boot and read order of files or something. In the end, I would like to know the answer to one or more of the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. Is .xsessionrc *supposed* to change this variable, but I have just messed up the code somehow\\r\\n 2. Is it possible to change the ```XDG_DATA_DIRS``` **at all *anywhere*** for the entirety of a session (and I guess for clarity, I mean my normal login as a typical desktop user until I shut down my computer)? I accept the fact that I may have simply not found the right place to issue this command.\\r\\n 3. I have not been using LXDE very long as a DE, have I just overlooked some simple GUI or config file that lets you define all this? I.e. I know KDE has a place specifically for defining environment variables via bash scripts in a certain folder, does the same hold true somewhere in LXDE?\\r\\n 4. In the worst case scenario, I know that there are some config files in /etc and /usr (seen [here][1]) but... is that really good practice, even for a single user operating system?\\r\\n\\r\\nAny help is appreciated.

I was and am under the impression that a file at <code>~/.xsessionrc</code> was the only way to have your DM set environmental variables for the entire login, whereas files like <code>~/.bash_profile</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code> could at best be done for the entirety of a single shell or terminal emulator being opened. For whatever it might matter, I am using LXDE with Openbox although I am fairly certain it doesn\\'t really matter as most versions of Debian seem to work about the same.</p>\\n<p>This is the entire contents of my <code>~/.xsessionrc</code> file:</p>\\n<pre><code>export XDG_DATA_DIRS=&quot;/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share:$XDG_DATA_DIRS&quot;\\n\\nexport PATH=&quot;$HOME/Archive/OS/Applications/.bin:$PATH&quot;\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Again, the <code>PATH</code> variable updates but <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> doesn\\'t seem to do anything. I was only interested in changing the <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> variable because of a blurb of text that showed up when trying to install Discord over <code>flatpak</code> in the terminal:</p>\\n<pre><code>Note that the directories \\n\\n\\'/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share\\'\\n\\'/home/animerrill/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share\\'\\n\\nare not in the search path set by the XDG_DATA_DIRS environment variable, so\\napplications installed by Flatpak may not appear on your desktop until the\\nsession is restarted.\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>And since the .desktop files for flatpak programs are automatically installed into those folders, I wanted to incorporate them through any means other than doing a ton of symbolic links manually every time I want to install a new flatpak program. Ideally, one would want to use the provided .desktop file since the dev probably knows what they\\'re doing in regards to their own program a lot of the time. Just for full clarity, the main reason I am concerned about this is because it\\'s the easiest way to have them appear in the shortcut menus, and also as such be used for shortcut icons and stuff.</p>\\n<p>Just to drive home the point, here is the output of both variables during the current session:</p>\\n<pre><code>animerrill@debian-laptop:~$ echo PATH: $PATH &amp;&amp; echo XDG_DATA_DIRS: $XDG_DATA_DIRS\\nPATH: /home/animerrill/Archive/OS/Applications/.bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games\\nXDG_DATA_DIRS: /usr/local/share:/usr/share:/usr/share/gdm:/var/lib/menu-xdg:/usr/local/share/:/usr/share/:/usr/share/gdm/:/var/lib/menu-xdg/\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Honestly I\\'m just more confused than anything. I assume, much like with a lot of other quirks about Linux, that I am just not in on the exact boot and read order of files or something. In the end, I would like to know the answer to one or more of the following:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Is .xsessionrc <em>supposed</em> to change this variable, but I have just messed up the code somehow</li>\\n<li>Is it possible to change the <code>XDG_DATA_DIRS</code> <strong>at all <em>anywhere</em></strong> for the entirety of a session (and I guess for clarity, I mean my normal login as a typical desktop user until I shut down my computer)? I accept the fact that I may have simply not found the right place to issue this command.</li>\\n<li>I have not been using LXDE very long as a DE, have I just overlooked some simple GUI or config file that lets you define all this? I.e. I know KDE has a place specifically for defining environment variables via bash scripts in a certain folder, does the same hold true somewhere in LXDE?</li>\\n<li>In the worst case scenario, I know that there are some config files in /etc and /usr (seen <a href=\"https://serverfault.com/questions/166383/how-set-path-for-all-users-in-debian\">here</a>) but... is that really good practice, even for a single user operating system?</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Any help is appreciated. Thanks!</p>\\n<p>~ AniMerrill</p>\\n'},\n",

       "   'body_markdown': 'Until the end of the last year I was one of the few people who used Google Play Music, and as it was discontinued, I downloaded all my music using Google Takeout. Now I have almost all of my songs in two versions, the one I uploaded to Google Play Music in the first place, and the one I downloaded with Takeout. Some of the ones I downloaded have higher quality than the ones I uploaded, but not all of them do. Now I imported all of the files into iTunes, and of cause have everything duplicated. \\r\\nNow to the question: Is there any way to automatically delete the lower quality file? I thought maybe iTunes would have the possibility, but so far I didn&#39;t find it. Is there such a possibility?\\r\\n\\r\\nAnything that works is appreciated, even if it is another programme, it doesn&#39;t have to be iTunes. In fact, I don&#39;t like iTunes that much, but I tried many other organising programmes like MusicBee, and so far I didn&#39;t find anything that I really liked. \\r\\n\\r\\nI found [this][1] post that describes a script that chooses which file to keep using the file size, but that assumes that the larger one is the one with higher quality, which is not always the case.

       "   'body_markdown': '### Preliminary note\\r\\n\\r\\nThis answer introduces commands valid in POSIX-compliant or almost POSIX-compliant operating systems, in particular in Linux or macOS. Commands are not for pure Windows (but I suppose the answer can be adjusted to work in WSL or Cygwin).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Analysis\\r\\n\\r\\nOK, you have copied some image to a USB drive `/dev/sdx`. In general you cannot exactly reverse the process basing solely on the content and properties of the drive because you don&#39;t know how many bytes to read. The upper bound is the size of the drive (64 GB in your case), everything else is a guess. The drive contains a stream of bytes and there is no mark saying &quot;stop reading here to get the original image&quot;.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy analyzing the partition table (if any) it&#39;s possible to take an educative guess. But even then you cannot be sure the original image was not larger (with garbage or non-garbage at the end).\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever you want to compare the result to some other image, let&#39;s call it `the_other_file`. I guess you hope the two images will be identical. To be identical they must be of the same size. This means you know how many bytes to read from `/dev/sdx`: the exact number of bytes `the_other_file` has. You can get this number by invoking\\r\\n\\r\\n    wc -c /path/to/the_other_file\\r\\n\\r\\nor\\r\\n\\r\\n    &lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c\\r\\n\\r\\nNote the former is a standalone command while the latter requires a shell (to handle `&lt;`). From now on I assume you&#39;re in a shell.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Copying\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your ultimate goal is to compare then you *don&#39;t need* to copy to a regular file. Read the whole answer before you decide. Still the explicit question is:\\r\\n\\r\\n&gt; How can I recreate an installer iso from a usb […] using `dd`?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems [`dd` is the only POSIX way to read an exact number of bytes from a file][1]. The way requires `ibs=1`, it can be slow. To read `N` bytes:\\r\\n\\r\\n    dd ibs=1 count=N if=/dev/sdx of=image_file\\r\\n\\r\\nThe resulting file is `image_file`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe original image, as an image designed to be written to a block device, most likely was of a size that is multiple of 512 bytes, possibly a multiple of 4096 bytes. You probably can use some bigger `ibs` then.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf `N` is an *exact* multiple of some bigger `ibs` you want to use then you can use the bigger `ibs` with `count` adjusted. The number after `count=` specifies how many blocks of the size `ibs` to read. Notes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `bs` specifies both `ibs` and `obs` (see `man 1 dd`).\\r\\n- Neither `bs=4m` (from your example) nor `bs=4M` belong to the [POSIX specification of `dd`][2]. The valid suffixes are `k` and `b`. You may be surprised the specification also allows strings in a form of `AxB`. To get 4 MiB use `bs=4kx1k`; to get 4 MB use `bs=4000000` or `bs=4000x1000` etc.\\r\\n- In general keep in mind `dd` is a cranky tool which is hard to use correctly. There are pitfalls. See [this][3] and [this][4].\\r\\n\\r\\nIf `N` is not an exact multiple of some bigger `ibs` you want to use, it&#39;s possible to read the majority of what you want to read with the large `ibs` and append the missing part while reading with `ibs=1`. This is cumbersome, requires some calculations, still it&#39;s technically possible; hardly ever useful though. If you are not limited to POSIX, there are better ways.\\r\\n\\r\\nGNU `dd` supports `iflag=count_bytes` that makes `count` count bytes regardless of `ibs`. Along with `iflag=fullblock` it makes `dd` a decent tool to read an exact number of bytes. In your case the command could be:\\r\\n\\r\\n    dd bs=4M iflag=fullblock,count_bytes count=N if=/dev/sdx of=image_file\\r\\n\\r\\nor (to avoid typing `N` manually):\\r\\n\\r\\n    dd bs=4M iflag=fullblock,count_bytes count=&quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; if=/dev/sdx of=image_file\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I were you I would use `head -c`:\\r\\n\\r\\n    head -c &quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; /dev/sdx &gt;image_file\\r\\n\\r\\nNote `wc -c` is portable (specified by POSIX) but `head -c` is not (although I believe `head` in macOS supports `-c`).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n### Comparing\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can compare directly, without creating any `image_file`. The following command is portable:\\r\\n\\r\\n    cmp /dev/sdx /path/to/the_other_file\\r\\n\\r\\nIn your case `/dev/sdx` is a device larger than `the_other_file`. You will get either a message (to stdout) the files differ, or a message (to stderr) `EOF on the_other_file`. In either case the exit status will be `1`. The latter message means the beginning of `/dev/sdx` is identical to `the_other_file`. This is what you would expect after copying `the_other_file` to `/dev/sdx`.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to judge by the exit status (useful in scripting) then you need to make sure you&#39;re comparing files of equal sizes. This is still possible without creating any `image_file`:\\r\\n\\r\\n    head -c &quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; /dev/sdx | cmp - /path/to/the_other_file\\r\\n\\r\\n(The exit status of a pipeline comes from the last command; here: from `cmp`.) Note `head -c` is (still `:)`) not portable. You can replace it with portable `dd …` if needed:\\r\\n\\r\\n    dd ibs=1 count=&quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; if=/dev/sdx | cmp - /path/to/the_other_file\\r\\n\\r\\nAlternatively after creating `image_file` as shown above, you can straightforwardly compare `image_file` to `the_other_file`:\\r\\n\\r\\n    cmp image_file the_other_file\\r\\n\\r\\nExit status `0` indicates the files are identical; exit status `1` indicates the files are not identical.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile working interactively you can pay attention to the output instead (I mean stdout + stderr, i.e. all what you normally see in a terminal). Empty output from `cmp` indicates the files are identical; non-empty output from `cmp` indicates whatever it says. Note `dd` (but not `head`) prints to stderr even if there was no error. I deliberately wrote &quot;empty output *from `cmp`*&quot;, not just &quot;empty output&quot;. When in doubt, check the exit status anyway: run `echo $?` just after (the pipeline ending with) `cmp`.\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/278465/108618\\r\\n  [2]: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/dd.html\\r\\n  [3]: https://unix.stackexchange.com/q/121865/108618\\r\\n  [4]: https://superuser.com/a/1075837/432690',\n",

The following command is portable:</p>\\n<pre><code>cmp /dev/sdx /path/to/the_other_file\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>In your case <code>/dev/sdx</code> is a device larger than <code>the_other_file</code>. You will get either a message (to stdout) the files differ, or a message (to stderr) <code>EOF on the_other_file</code>. In either case the exit status will be <code>1</code>. The latter message means the beginning of <code>/dev/sdx</code> is identical to <code>the_other_file</code>. This is what you would expect after copying <code>the_other_file</code> to <code>/dev/sdx</code>.</p>\\n<p>If you want to judge by the exit status (useful in scripting) then you need to make sure you\\'re comparing files of equal sizes. This is still possible without creating any <code>image_file</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code>head -c &quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; /dev/sdx | cmp - /path/to/the_other_file\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>(The exit status of a pipeline comes from the last command; here: from <code>cmp</code>.) Note <code>head -c</code> is (still <code>:)</code>) not portable. You can replace it with portable <code>dd …</code> if needed:</p>\\n<pre><code>dd ibs=1 count=&quot;$(&lt;/path/to/the_other_file wc -c)&quot; if=/dev/sdx | cmp - /path/to/the_other_file\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Alternatively after creating <code>image_file</code> as shown above, you can straightforwardly compare <code>image_file</code> to <code>the_other_file</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code>cmp image_file the_other_file\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Exit status <code>0</code> indicates the files are identical; exit status <code>1</code> indicates the files are not identical.</p>\\n<p>While working interactively you can pay attention to the output instead (I mean stdout + stderr, i.e. all what you normally see in a terminal). Empty output from <code>cmp</code> indicates the files are identical; non-empty output from <code>cmp</code> indicates whatever it says. Note <code>dd</code> (but not <code>head</code>) prints to stderr even if there was no error. I deliberately wrote &quot;empty output <em>from <code>cmp</code></em>&quot;, not just &quot;empty output&quot;. When in doubt, check the exit status anyway: run <code>echo $?</code> just after (the pipeline ending with) <code>cmp</code>.</p>\\n'},\n",

       "   'body_markdown': 'Can you browse the internet while connected to WIFI and not logged in? If it is showing no internet access, maybe it just means you can&#39;t access the internet through HTTP/HTTPs, HTTP uses TCP port 80, HTTPs uses TCP port 443, and if these ports are banned while you aren&#39;t logged in you can&#39;t browse the internet, but the fact you can download files through uTorrent suggests that the other ports are open and not banned, standard BitTorrent protocol uses ports 6881 through 6889, however in reality BitTorrent clients may use any port available(maximum possible TCP port number is 65535), maybe these ports are not banned and can allow communication.\\r\\n\\r\\nA possible way to verify this theory is to try to ping an external public IP address while connected to WIFI and not internet, I don&#39;t know about India but here behind the GFW I can still ping 8.8.8.8 even with VPN off, so I think ping 8.8.8.8 is good. If the result isn&#39;t timeout, it means you have network connectivity, but unable to browse the webpages if it shows No Internet Access, maybe the message actually means &quot;can&#39;t connect to the internet through port 80,443(and possibly 20, 21 for FTP)&quot;, means no HTTP(s) and FTP access but it doesn&#39;t indicate the other protocols aren&#39;t working.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote Ping requests utilize ICMP and don&#39;t use TCP ports. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n----------\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) port number is a 16 bit unsigned integer (0 - 65535 or 2^16-1) as a label in the header of an IP (Internet Protocol) packet, that&#39;s used together with with the IP address (32 bit unsigned integer for IPv4 or 128 bit unsigned integer for IPv6) to denote where the packet should be send to, like 151.101.1.69:80, the first is one of the IPv4 addresses of superuser.com, the second is the port number. IP address says which machine should receive the packet, and port number says which application.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you type website addresses to address bar, for example superuser.com, the webpage address is automatically resolved to IP addresses by DNS servers so that computers can know where to send.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don&#39;t know about the older days of internet but today in 2020s web browsers autocompletes webpage addresses and protocols, for example typing google.com in the address bar it automatically resolves to https://www.google.com, and it is the same as https://www.google.com:443, the port number is automatically added based on protocol, 443 for HTTPS(HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure), port 80 for HTTP and 20 for FTP (File Transfer Protocol).\\r\\n\\r\\nNowadays web browsers automatically use HTTPS connections, typing google.com and hitting Enter will automatically lead you to https://www.google.com:443, even if you specificy the protocol and port number: http://www.google.com:80, it will automatically redirect you to the HTTPS one(indicated by the locked lock symbol, clicking the address bar will show full address).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe web request is sent out as an outbound IP packet towards the server, the website address is automatically translated to IP address by DNS (Domain Name System) servers (or your hosts file if it finds a entry for the web address first), typically directly using IP address in the address bar wouldn&#39;t work, and then your packet goes through routers modems and firewalls, lots of firewalls, typically firewalls will inspect the receiver&#39;s IP address and prevent the packet from reaching its receiver if the receiver&#39;s IP is banned, among other things.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever in your case, the packet goes through the firewall of your local WIFI first, the firewall inspects the ports of the receiver, and if it&#39;s 20,80,443,6875 and possibly others while you aren&#39;t logged in, it simply ends the transmission of the packet, for you to access a website you need to send an outbound packet to the server and the server has to send back an inbound packet to you, now the outbound packet never reaches its destination and that&#39;s it, however not all ports are banned, as you have discovered, ports 6885, 48000 and 50000 aren&#39;t banned, so the firewall only intercepts ports in the blacklist and doesn&#39;t intercept ports not in blacklist.\\r\\n\\r\\nBrilliant step on diagnosis, really, changing the port number uTorrent uses is the right step, and about ping timeout, there are two possibilities: 1, your country&#39;s firewall or any number of firewalls between you and Google had banned 8.8.8.8(not likely); 2, in addition to TCP/UDP ports, ICMP is also banned (most likely). To know which is the case, log in to your WIFI and ping 8.8.8.8 again, if still timeout then the first one is correct, if not then the second one.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n----------\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd about how the firewall prevents your packet from reaching the destination, it is very simple; There is no central server of the internet, internet isn&#39;t provided by one big ISP, but rather peering of multiple ISPs and consists of God knows how many hops, nodes, routers and computers, smart phones and so on and so forth, these things interconnected form the internet.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink of IP packets like letters, the letters are put in envelopes, and on the envelopes are the receivers&#39; building address (IP address) and room number (port number) which specify where the letter should be send to, only the receiver has the right to open the envelope and view tge contents, however everyone can see the destination of the letter(so that they can send it forward), you give your letter to your first postman (the router that gives you WIFI), and it&#39;s his duty to send it forward to the next postman (node in internet) in line, and through many postmen the letter will reach its destination, now your letter isn&#39;t stamped and the first postman sees the room number should only be reachable if the letter is stamped, so he refuses to send it to the next postman, that&#39;s it.',\n",

I have most of the protections you recommended already enabled. I&#39;m not forwarding port 22 on the router and ssh is using another port.

What I don't understand is, how are these probes even reaching my machine behind the LAN? There are a couple of port forwards from the router to my machine, but these guys are targeting random ports and they seem to be reaching this specific machine. From my understanding of networks they should be denied at the router.</p>\\n<p>Why is this happening? What is this a symptom of? What do you recommend?</p>\\n<p><strong>edit:</strong> Thank you all. I have most of the protections you recommended already enabled. I'm not forwarding port 22 on the router and ssh is using another port. What I really don't understand is these requests hitting my machine instead of... my printer/cellphones/laptops or just being blocked by the router. I'm actually considering buying a new router because of this as I think this one is compromised.</p>\\n\"},\n",

Scott Fitzgerald =  Fitzgerald, F.  \\nW.E.B. Du Bois = Du Bois, W.E.B.  \\nJohn F. Kennedy = Kennedy, John  \\n</code></pre>\\n\"},\n",

For example, the Samsung 980 Pro hits 7.1 GB/s (peak sequential read, 128KB blocks) which represents 90% of the theoretical bandwidth of the x4 PCIe 4.0 connection between the PCH and a PCIe 4.0 CPU;\\r\\n 3. considering point #2 above, that x4 PCIe 4.0 NVME drive might be bottlenecked if, in parallel, there are some Sata 3 SSDs and/or USB 3.2 Gen 2 10 Gbps (which is the max USB port speed on X570) devices transferring data; that, however, depends on the overall build and its different usage scenarios, as well as the particular type of data transfer which is being processed (read vs. write, sequential or not, small vs. big files, etc.);\\r\\n 4. again considering point #2, if only the PCH-side NVME connection is being used for intense data transfer at some given time, then the bottleneck risk would be lower; but then again that depends on the amount of overhead data that is being processed on the potentially idling SATA, USB and other devices (1 Gb/s ethernet, WAN, audio, etc.) at that particular time;\\r\\n 5. numbers will be different for a CPU that is PCIe 3.0 and not PCIe 4.0 to begin with, but the same logic will apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs for your other sub-questions:\\r\\n\\r\\n 1. a GPU card will not be impacted, provided it runs on the GPU-dedicated x16 logical lanes via 1, 2 or more physical slot(s) connected straight to the CPU on the motherboard. However, if the card is running on a &quot;secondary&quot; x1, x4, x8 or x16 physical slot connected via the PCH, it would then be capped to x1, x4 or x8 logically at the slot level depending on motherboard implementation, and then overall still logically capped to x4 under the best circumstances via the *shared* x4 logical connection between the PCH and CPU;\\r\\n 2. you did not define what &quot;first SSD&quot; means; if it means NVME #1 (connected to CPU) then it will not be impacted as long as nothing else is connected to that x4 off the CPU. Because in fact the Ryzen architecture allows that x4 from the CPU to be shared with more devices, either two(2) x2 PCIe M.2, or one(1) x2 PCIe M.2 plus two(2) SATA (either M.2&#39;s or traditional ports). That however, depends entirely on the implementation on the particular motherboard model.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor reference, here are the bandwidth calculations for x1, x4, x8, x16 lanes :\\r\\n\\r\\nPCIe 3 :\\r\\n\\r\\nx1 = 8 GT/s bandwidth (nominal)\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to 128b/130b encoding : 8 GT/s * (128b/130b) = 7.8769 Gbps\\r\\n\\r\\nand 1 GB/s = 8 Gbps, so...\\r\\n - x1 = 0.985 GB/s = 984.615 MB/s\\r\\n - x4 = 3.938 GB/s = 3,938.462 MB/s\\r\\n - x8 = 7.877 GB/s = 7,876.923 MB/s\\r\\n - x16 = 15.754 GB/s = 15,753.846 MB/s\\r\\n\\r\\nPCIe 4 :\\r\\n\\r\\nx1 = 16 GT/s bandwidth (nominal)\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to 128b/130b encoding : 16GT/s * (128b/130b) = 15.7538 Gbps\\r\\n\\r\\nand 1 GB/s = 8 Gbps, so...\\r\\n - x1 = 1.969 GB/s = 3,938.462 MB/s\\r\\n - x4 = 7.877 GB/s = 7,876.923 MB/s\\r\\n - x8 = 15.754 GB/s = 15,753.846 MB/s\\r\\n - x16  = 31.508 GB/s = 31,507.692 MB/s\\r\\n\\r\\n',\n",

To investigate this I have:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>mounted SD card under my Windows 10,</li>\\n<li>run <code>cmd</code> as an administrator,</li>\\n<li>navigated to SD card root,</li>\\n<li>executed <code>dir</code> command.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I have received following output:</p>\\n<pre><code> Volume in drive D has no label.\\n Volume Serial Number is 36BA-963E\\n\\n Directory of D:\\\\\\n\\n05.06.2018  23:00       159ÿ280ÿ594 02.

To make that easier yet, create shortcuts to the two scripts and set in Advanced properties to *Run as Administrator*.\\r\\n\\r\\nBelieve it or not, despite the long description, you can do this in just a few minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\n**N.B.** Once you&#39;ve disabled the keyboard, you&#39;ll need some way to run the re-enabling script **without use of the keboard*.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n  [1]: https://superuser.com/questions/1002950/quick-method-to-install-devcon-exe\\r\\n  [2]: https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/4/0/140EBDB7-F631-4191-9DC0-31C8ECB8A11F/wdk/Installers/787bee96dbd26371076b37b13c405890.cab\\r\\n  [3]: https://www.7-zip.org/\\r\\n  [4]: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload',\n",

See how the left <kbd>Shift</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> are different than in the above layout. The holes in the chassis are identical though.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9FOTS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9FOTS.png\" alt=\"Russian layout\" /></a></p>\\n<p><sup>(source: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8HjMOUNd878&amp;t=267\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>How to replace keyboard on Acer Aspire V3-731, V3-771 laptop</em></a>)</sup></p>\\n<p>Yet another layout (looks Japanese). It\\'s from an <em>older</em> Acer Aspire model; the model seem to use the same layout of holes.

The drives are visible in Windows disk management tool as two separate drives with anonymus partition (Dysk 0 and Dysk 1 in picture below) and in BIOS system status.</p>\\n<p>I tried to install <a href=\"https://www.amd.com/en/support/chipsets/amd-socket-am4/x570\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AMD RAID Installer</a> but it won\\'t go through.</p>\\n<p>Is there a way to recover the array?</p>\\n<p>My system: Windows 10 64b, AMD Ryzen 9 5950x, MSI mag x570 tomahawk Wi-Fi</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BUuPj.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Disks Manager screenshot</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Wje5X.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BIOS System Status</a></p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YSpbO.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BIOS Array Proporties</a></p>\\n'},\n",
