# Configurations Instructions for point label format

Consider a point label metadata string example - 

`EBU3B.1ST-FLR.RM-1244.VAV-1N25.ZN-T`

Assuming '.' as a delimiter, the string above will be split into 5 parts. Hence, the user will be required to specify a list in the `point_label_format` of length 5 in the data-params.json file to sequentially specify how a column of each part should be treated/parsed.

Every single element of the list should be specified as per one of three possibilities:
1. `null` if the part is of no use.
2. string (among {UpstreamAHU, ZoneName, VAVName, BrickClass}) depending upon the semantic meaning of the part.
3. list of any of the column names (specified in (2)), if a column generated by a part needs to be replicated.


# General Configurations & descriptions:

1. `fp`: file path of the csv dataset
2. `point_label_col`: column in the dataset containing the point label info
3. `delimiter`: 
  (a) `pattern`: string pattern to serve as a delimiter
  (b) `regex`: boolean for regex delimiters
4. `point_label_format`: Described above.
5. `additional_brick_class_info_columns`: Default [], auxiliary column to include as features for Brick class predictions
6. `drop_null_rows`: boolean, dropping rows with any null values. Recommended `true`.
