# Why Use DANE?

DANE provides two core functionalities:

1. Automatically collect network traffic datasets in a parallelized manner, without background noise

   Manual data collection for network traffic datasets is a long and tedious process—run the tool and you can easily collect multiple hours of data in one hour of time (magic!) with one or many desired 'user' behaviors. These behaviors run in an isolated environment so you don't need to worry about interference from any background services.

2. Emulate a diverse range of network conditions that are representative of the real world

   Data representation is an increasingly relevant issue in all fields of data science, but generating a dataset while connected to a fixed network doesn't capture diversity in network conditions—in a single file, you can configure DANE to emulate a variety of network conditions, including latency and bandwidth.

By default DANE utilizes a VPN connection and collects data using [network-stats](https://github.com/Viasat/network-stats/), but these choices are modifiable. You can easily hack the tool to run custom scripts, custom data collection tools, and other custom software dependencies which support your particular research interest.
