DANE is a hackable dataset generation tool to collect network traffic in a variety of configurable network conditions. Source code available [here](https://github.com/dane-tool/dane/).

Our tool establishes Docker containers with configurable network conditions,
then runs target and customizable behaviors such as browsing the internet, and collects data on
the network traffic generated using
[network-stats](https://github.com/Viasat/network-stats). It supports Windows, Mac, and Linux.
