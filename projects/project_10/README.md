DANE is a hackable dataset generation tool to collect network traffic in a variety of configurable network conditions.

It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Why use DANE?

DANE provides two core functionalities:

1. Automatically collect network traffic datasets in a parallelized manner

   Manual data collection for network traffic datasets is a long and tedious processâ€”run the tool and you can easily collect multiple hours of data in one hour of time (magic!) with one or many desired 'user' behaviors.
   
2. Emulate a diverse range of network conditions that are representative of the real world

   Data representation is an increasingly relevant issue in all fields of data science, but generating a dataset while connected to a fixed network doesn't capture diversity in network conditionsâ€”in a single file, you can configure DANE to emulate a variety of network conditions, including latency and bandwidth.

You can easily hack the tool to run custom scripts, custom data collection tools, and other custom software dependencies which support your particular research interest.
